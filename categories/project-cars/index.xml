&lt;p>There comes a point in time when people decide that they want to make a change in life. For me, that change was owning a BMW. The first I heard of BMW’s was as a kid going to the auto show with my father, and grandfather. It wasn’t until high school that I really became a car guy. The very first time I rode in a E39 was in 2011, with Ryan’s 2000 E39 M5. I immediately fell in love with that car, and knew that I had to have one. It wasn’t until 4 years later that I can finally say that I am a proud owner of a BMW. I purchased this vehicle off of my good friend, Razvan who gave me a fantastic deal on this beautiful machine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alex’s 2000 BMW E46 328i Introduction</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/alexs-2000-bmw-e46-328i-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/alexs-2000-bmw-e46-328i-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_3171.jpg" alt="Alt text">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I were to tell you that I’ve always been a fan of BMW, I’d be lying. Two years ago, if you were to tell me my first car would be an E46, I would have called you crazy! Living in Buffalo, NY, I pictured my first car as some sort of all wheel drive vehicle. I really was set on an older WRX, due to the decent performance, and great all wheel drive system. I was also your typical Fast and Furious type kid who drooled over JDM “riced” out cars. It’s bad, I know. Luckily, one trip to visit my brother in San Francisco changed my taste in cars completely.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Andrew’s 2000 BMW M5 Introduction</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/andrews-2000-bmw-m5-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/andrews-2000-bmw-m5-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Andrew-M5.png" alt="Alt text">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M5 ownership is a grand experience, even though it has been riddled with mistakes, hard work, and pure luck. My name is Andrew, and I didn’t start out with my current M5, but rather another BMW: my mother’s 2003 E53 X5. It has the 3.0 liter M54 motor, and a religious service history from the dealer/independent specialists so I would never be let down. It took me until halfway through my senior year in high school and I was using the X5’s utility to the max. I was a three sport athlete, and also a volunteer fire fighter, so I was driving to-and-from practice, my home, and the fire house quite often. A plain soccer-mobile X5 was boring for a trending high school senior, so I started to modify it subtly. However, the interior got hit hard with my crazy hormones, and my style reflected that; I put plaid fabric over the wood trim, and vinyled my center console so all my friends could sign it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Andrew’s New Benz!</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/andrews-new-benz/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/andrews-new-benz/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_5355.jpg" alt="Alt text">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My past BMW’s were fun cars. I had a great time driving them, and I learned a lot fixing them. However, they got a bit repetitive after having cars so similar: the E53 X5, E36 318ti, and the E36 328i. These all shared so much in common that I could go through the motions to change out a thermostat or replace an oil filter housing gasket with my eyes closed. So, what does a car guy do when they need a new project to tinker on? He moves on and gets a 1995 W124 Mercedes E320!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BMW’s Bastard Child: My E36 318ti</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/bmws-bastard-child-my-e36-318ti/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/bmws-bastard-child-my-e36-318ti/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Exterior.jpg" alt="Alt text">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s keep things short, and get this started. I sold my E39 M5 at a good price, but I still miss it dearly. I’m in college studying engineering and pre-med, so I’m going to be in school for a long time. I don’t have the time anymore for photo shoots, car washes and detailing all the time. I needed something cheap, reliable and plain; and it had to be a good project car for some great E39Source content. I decided to buy a Ti – it’s a big F-U to all the viewer’s that thought I was going to get something flashy, and worst of all, everybody hates how it looks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Charlie’s 2002 BMW 520i SE Introduction</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/charlies-2002-bmw-520i-se-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/charlies-2002-bmw-520i-se-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/DSC_0037.jpg" alt="Alt text">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hi everyone, I’m really excited to share my new vehicle with you! I have always wanted a saloon, or sedan as you guys in the states call them. I am a tall guy, 6’7″, so trying to find the right vehicle is a pain! I have to find one first, and ask to sit in the car, which is always an awkward conversation. If I fit in it, then I know what to look for. I originally wanted something classy, like a Mercedes-Benz, but then I realized the costs of repair would be astronomical, and I really didn’t think at my age, 19, it would be very sensible. I then remembered how my step dad always loved his BMW. He had a 1999 3-series, and I loved it. He actually destroyed it by putting on big tires and stupid suspension, meaning that when you went round a bend, you could smell and hear the rubber burning on the wheel arch. That car though was the birth of my strong desire to own a BMW.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Christian’s 1999 540i Introduction</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/christians-1999-540i-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/christians-1999-540i-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/bmw4.jpg" alt="Alt text">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As far back as I can remember I have been obsessed with cars, and most recently that obsession has been channeled to my 1999 540i. My passion for cars is definitely in my family’s blood. My grandpa had a very strong interest in cars, some of which are some of the most beautiful cars from the 20th century in my opinion. These cars included a 1969 Signal Orange Porsche 911E, 1958 Blue Jaguar XK-140 convertible, 1968 Jaguar E-type convertible in Tan, and a 1966 Lincoln Continental convertible in Black with the suicide doors. Growing up around these cars gave me a solid understanding about cars and how awesome they can be.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Christian’s 2000 BMW E46 330ci</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/christains-2000-bmw-e46-330ci/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/christains-2000-bmw-e46-330ci/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/32792736756_149d324a3a.jpg" alt="Alt text">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Christian’s family had tried a BMW before- and it didn’t go well. What was so terrible about that first BMW? What is it about this E46 330ci that changed things? This is the story of Christian’s first car- a 2000 E46 finished in Oxford Green metallic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;br/>&lt;br/>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I never thought I would say this, but I bought a BMW! Let me give that statement some context. BMW’s don’t have the best reputation in my family. My Dad owned a 2005 BMW E65 735i Sport from 2009-2010. “The most unreliable car I’ve ever owned”, in his words. It was a brilliant machine to drive, and was actually the very first car I drove prior to learning how to drive a manual. Cue the haters, but I am a partial lover of the infamous bangle-butt generation of the BMW 7. Something about it screams unparalleled practicality whilst also having supercomputer power. However, that was also the car’s achilles heel. The E65 was just stupidly complicated. My Father’s example had numerous problems with the iDrive system, engine timing chain components, and a large number of sensors that simply decided to go on strike and stop working for no apparent reason. As you could’ve guessed, this caused the car’s systems to go haywire. All those headaches from an (at the time) 5 year old with only 65,000km. This was supposed to be The Ultimate Driving Machine. What was I in for when I purchased my 16 year old, 110,000km 330ci? One word: bliss.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Colton’s 2001 BMW 540i Introduction</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/coltons-2001-bmw-540i-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/coltons-2001-bmw-540i-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/540_Driveway1.png" alt="Alt text">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Thursday, September 6th, 2012 at 5:08am I turned the key to the first ignition slot on what would turn into one of the biggest decisions of my life thus far. Let me start from the beginning. I’ve always been interested in automobiles, ever since I was a young boy. I was the boy who had a box full of matchbox cars which I would drive around on the floor for hours imagining different scenarios. I had quite the imagination. As I grew older, I started to lean towards Ford trucks, mainly because my father had purchased a 2002 F-150 Super-crew. That truck was all I knew as far as vehicles were concerned, that was until I met a friend of mine: Ryan Schultz.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Compromise – Updates with Andrew and His 2000 M5</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/compromise-updates-with-andrew-and-his-2000-m5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/compromise-updates-with-andrew-and-his-2000-m5/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-5.17.27-PM.png" alt="Alt text">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve had my M5 for about seven months now, but I have only driven it 2500 miles. That is plenty of time to get familiar with my vehicle, but not enough to determine it’s reliability. For example, when I went to top off the tank before putting my M5 back into storage, it threw an SES code on the cluster. I plugged in my cheap-o generic OBDII scanner, and it came up with a P1526 and P0022 code, “A” Camshaft Position Actuator Control Open Circuit Bank 2 and “A” Camshaft Position – Timing over-retarded (Bank 2) respectively. I had the same two related codes over the summer when I first got my car, and that was when I opened up my bank 2 VANOS solenoids to check their operation. I have now confirmed that I need an intake CPS (Camshaft Position Sensor), which I plan on doing in late May.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Danny’s Imola 2000 BMW M5</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/dannys-imola-2000-bmw-m5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/dannys-imola-2000-bmw-m5/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/M5_1.jpg" alt="Alt text">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was contemplating doing a video of the car and recorded one only to realize that my spoken English isn’t what it once was (Swedish sing-a-song-accent haha) so I’ll make a written post of my recently acquired M5 instead. I found out about the car a few months ago via a friend and I loosely knew the previous owner before as I were childhood friends with his brother.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Daryl’s 2001 525i Introduction</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/daryls-2001-525i-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/daryls-2001-525i-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/E39-Project-021-1-of-1.jpg" alt="Alt text">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>G’day from sunny Brisbane, Queensland Australia! I’m Daryl, however I go by the online name Dodgy Haro on most car forums (clubroadster + club4AG) which I participate in. My car background is mainly JDM (previous AE86 and Na6 Miata owner amongst other cars) however I do appreciate European rides too and how they generally handle better on highways and don’t impart that plastic feeling you get from some Japanese cars. I’ve just taken delivery of my new (old) 2001 BMW E39 525i sedan in gorgeous Imola red about a week ago. She is a bit tatty cosmetic-wise however she is a diamond in the rough to my eyes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fabien’s 2001 BMW Alpina B10 Introduction</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/fabiens-2001-bmw-alpina-b10-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/fabiens-2001-bmw-alpina-b10-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/31632002_CP_photo.jpeg" alt="Alt text">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The BMW E39 Alpina B10 V8 is based on the 540i. Restoration is on-going on this car. It is claimed to produce 347BHP and 450 Nm (332 lb/ft) of toque for the 4.6 M62B46 V8. The Alpina documentation specific to this car states power output to be 355BHP and 480 Nm (354 lb/ft).

&lt;p>I have always been really into cars; I can still remember my briefcase toy chest filled with hot wheels race cars. I used to love those things, I took them everywhere with me! The doctor’s office, on vacations, you name it, I always brought some little toy cars with me. I was a boy who loved cars, like many others. Like many little boys, I dreamed of driving a race car and going 300mph, and having the time of my life. Fast forward to March, 2012. I was behind the wheel of a 2002 BMW 530i, driving in a parking lot at no more than 5mph. I was very excited, and very nervous. It was my first time ever getting behind the wheel of a car and actually driving it. After some short practice time in parking lots, I hit the road with my dad.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ivor’s 2001 BMW 530i Introduction</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/ivors-2001-bmw-530i-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/ivors-2001-bmw-530i-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/3Gd3Fd3M25E95Kd5M5d62579040ac838c104d.jpg" alt="Alt text">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is my 2001 BMW 530i 5 speed. I bought this car in June of this year from a guy in Minnesota. I found the car on Craigslist, and bought it for $6,500, which was a great deal. I originally wanted an M5, but they were out of my price range, so I started looking for a 540i. After some research, I found out that the V8s are a pain to repair, and the MPGs are awful, so I decided to go for a 530i. I was specifically looking for a 530i with a manual box, which was difficult to find in South Dakota. After searching for about 3 weeks, I found this one. It met all of my criteria: facelift model with the angel eyes, 5 speed box, M bumpers, BBS style wheels, it just had my name written all over it! After about a week, it was finally in my driveway: my first BMW! Below are the pictures of it from the Craigslist ad.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jackson’s 2002 BMW E39 M5 Introduction</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/jacksons-2002-bmw-e39-m5-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/jacksons-2002-bmw-e39-m5-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../img/DSC_0082.jpeg" alt="Alt text">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hello everyone, I hope winter is going well so far! I’ve been a long-time member on M5Board, and I thought I’d swing over to this neighborhood to check out the scene! It’s a great technical and video based site in my opinion. My name is Jackson, and I live all the way up in Minnesota, also known as a**hole in the winter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;br/>&lt;br/>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To begin, I’ve always loved the E39 chassis. It was actually my first love as a child, and will always be my favorite platform on any automobile. I wouldn’t trade it for anything else. Once I was around more friends’ E39 M5s in college, I knew I wanted one, and set out to get a decent job, and start saving. Not more than a year and a half later, I found the right M5. True E39 enthusiasts WILL wait for the right car, and numerous nights have been spent awake going over all sorts of things that would come up. Color, accident history, condition, owner feedback, distance, etc. They were all obstacles on the checklist that I needed to cross off, and more times than not, my checklist was incomplete.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jay’s 2000 BMW E39 M5</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/jays-2000-bmw-e39-m5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/jays-2000-bmw-e39-m5/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160428_080940.jpg" alt="Alt text">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hello E39Source! I am a new member to this website, and I wanted to get more involved with this close knit group of E39 enthusiasts. I just recently purchased my first M5! I bought it in Seattle, Washington with 148,000 miles on the clock. The interior is immaculate, along with the rest of the car. It honestly doesn’t feel as if it has covered 148,000 miles. I’ve driven upwards of ten M5s and this one takes the cake. It has plenty of get-up and go and, so far has none of the common E39 issues!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Josh’s 2001 530i Introduction</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/joshs-2001-530i-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/joshs-2001-530i-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1.jpg" alt="Alt text">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Germany has always meant a great deal to me for a variety of reasons.

&lt;p>Let me begin by saying that I may be slightly biased when it comes to my assured claim that the E39 M5 is the greatest sports sedan of all time. While there are many other remarkable performance sedans out there (E28 M5, E34 M5, W211 E55, C5 RS6, and countless others), the E39 has held a special place in my heart from a young age. Not many other sedans have aged as gracefully and the E39 M5 represents the perfect blend between past and present in the M5 lineage. While its performance is not as remarkably impressive by today’s standards, the E39 M5 blends the right amount of driver involvement with refinement.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mike’s E39 528i &amp; M5 Introduction</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/mikes-e39-528i-and-m5-indroduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/mikes-e39-528i-and-m5-indroduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/26350336544_98285c3d7d_o.jpg" alt="Alt text">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hey guys, thanks for welcoming me to E39source! I’ve been a YouTube subscriber for quite a while now, and actually met some of you at the Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix last summer. My name is Mike, and I’m 25 years old and live/work in West Chester, PA. I currently have two E39s: a 1997 528i, and a 2000 M5.&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;br/>&lt;br/>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My 528i is a 3/96 build, with almost 305k miles on it now. This was my first car, and I’ve owned it for over 8 years and 60k miles now! I’ve done so much maintenance to this car, most notably the top end rebuild that was done at 275k miles due to a leaking head gasket. At the time the head gasket was replaced, all seals in top end were replaced, along with the addition of S52 cams and Raceland headers. I also fitted a new radiator and water pump. This is an automatic-transmission car, and as far as I know, the transmission fluid is still original. The engine is the original M52 as well. As far as mods go, I’ve done quite a bit to this car to make it my own. Performance wise I already mentioned the S52 cams and headers but this winter I’m going to have a Supersprint resonator delete, and a Vibrant muffler installed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ryan’s 2003 BMW 530iA Introduction</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/ryans-2003-bmw-530ia-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/ryans-2003-bmw-530ia-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_7645.jpg" alt="Alt text">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve held a strong interest in cars, though my parents accredit that to a toy school bus I had as a toddler. After I turned four, I would point to cars on the road and ask my dad what they were. His limited automotive knowledge meant that every SUV was a Jeep to me; everything else was a mishmash. Through clipping pictures of nice cars out of magazines, collecting Hot Wheels sized cars, and reading the undercarriage for the label, I started to form a vague understanding of what I was seeing on the road.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tanvir’s 2003 BMW M5 Information</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/tanvirs-2003-bmw-m5-information/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/tanvirs-2003-bmw-m5-information/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/My-M3-Close-front-after..jpg" alt="Alt text">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My story starts a little differently than others. It starts 13 years ago… with a different kind of BMW than the one that I now own. One that, in my opinion, is by far the finest thing to come from Germany in a very long time… The E30 M3. I owned that icon for 11 memorable years, and still marvel that I was fortunate enough to own something so pure in it’s DNA, something that rewarded your driver input, and never punished you when you got it wrong. But, as this is a post about the E39 M5 I now have, let’s fast forward to November, 2010.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tyler’s 1993 BMW 325iS Information</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/tylers-1993-bmw-325is-information/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/tylers-1993-bmw-325is-information/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tyler-325is1.png" alt="Alt text">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My story with my E36 is one of passion, heartbreak, persistence, hard work, and courage. That may sound a bit like the makings of a shoddy Lifetime movie, but I promise you this will be more entertaining than that. In my mind, this article is going to sound like something from Dan Neil in the WSJ. Instead, it may come off a bit like something a 17 year-old wrote one day while playing hooky… and that’d be correct. The first time I saw the little E36 was about 3 years ago, I was 14. Somehow I looked passed all of its imperfections, and it sparked my interest in E36s. It’s a 1993 brillantrot 325iS that a good friend of ours bought from a broke Princeton student who knew nothing about cars. It was advertised on South Jersey Craigslist with a blown engine. After a good friend purchased it, he diagnosed the problem as being a damaged clutch fan. It was fixed, but never registered to be driven.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
