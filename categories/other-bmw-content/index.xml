It will continue to be offered with its 560-hp, twin-turbo, 4.4-liter V-8, but there will also be an optional performance pack- called the Competition Package, which will consist of several upgrades to the current M5.
The output of the higher-performance M5 and M6 models will rise from 560 to 575 horsepower.</description></item><item><title>BMW Alarm Goes Off? Hood Sensor Replacement</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/bmw-alarm-goes-off-hood-sensor-replacement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/bmw-alarm-goes-off-hood-sensor-replacement/</guid><description>Is your alarm going off randomly? In most cases, your culprit is a small hood security switch in the engine bay that takes no more than a few minutes to replace!
Depending on which BMW model you own, you may have a ‘clown nose’ red light on your rear-view mirror. When you lock your car, this light should flash, every ~3 seconds or so. If the car thinks there is a fault in the alarm system (hood sensor failure) the light will flash rapidly, maybe 2 times per second or more immediately after locking.</description></item><item><title>BMW Answers Tesla with a “Green” Supercar</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/bmw-answers-tesla-with-a-green-supercar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/bmw-answers-tesla-with-a-green-supercar/</guid><description>Up till now, Tesla has had the market for high-end electric cars pretty much to itself. But that first-mover advantage is ending. BMW has just rolled out the i8, a plug-in supercar that will test just how much big spenders are willing to pay for a racer with a green badge. This real-life Batmobile starts at about $140,000, but availability is limited for now, and some sellers are asking well over $200,000 for the car.</description></item><item><title>BMW at the 2013 Detroit Auto Show</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/bmw-at-the-2013-detroit-auto-show/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/bmw-at-the-2013-detroit-auto-show/</guid><description>I’ve attended nearly ten consecutive showings of the Cleveland Auto Show, held at the International Exposition Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Only last year did we decide to hit the Detroit show too, known as NAIAS, or North American International Auto Show. We took my Dad’s 2008 X530is, and it ended up being a really nice show. BMW showcased the F30 3-series in each of the three trims, the F10 M5, and i3 and i8 concept vehicles.</description></item><item><title>BMW Depreciation: E30 M3, E36 M3, E39 M5.

There will always be a car that is more comfortable, there will always be a car more reliable, there will always be a car that is faster, and there will always be a car that is just better. However, at the price point E39 M5’s are at, it is a great do-it-all car. And that is why I keep it around.</description></item><item><title>BMW E36: Bi-Xenon Headlight Retrofit</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/bmw-e36-bi-xenon-headlight-retrofit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/bmw-e36-bi-xenon-headlight-retrofit/</guid><description>How do you get high intensity lighting for under $200 $50? Easy, peasy, lemon squeeze: all you need to do is retrofit your stock plastic lens E36 headlights with bi-xenon projectors. With some modification from a Dremel, razor blade, and a pry tool, you too can have HID lighting without resorting to a eat-ramen-every-night college-esque budget.

Prior to ~2011, BMW had used very yellow and dim lights to illuminate the rear tag. These days they’re using significantly brighter LEDs that produce a very crisp and white colored light. I installed these lights into my 2000 M5, and have been happy with the results. They do NOT trigger a ‘check warning’ on the dash.</description></item><item><title>BMW E39: Corner Sunshade Replacement</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/bmw-e39-corner-sunshade-replacement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/bmw-e39-corner-sunshade-replacement/</guid><description>This article will detail the removal and re-installation of the corner sunshade on the rear doors of the E39 5-series.

There is a problem with the positive battery cable; the tin on the connector may degrade over time, causing electrical problems, stalling, or even a complete loss of power while the vehicle is in motion. The affected vehicles include: 1 Series coupes and convertibles (both 128i and 135i) from the 2008 to 2011 model years; 3 Series sedans, coupes, convertibles and sport wagons (both 328i and 335i) from the 2007 to 2012 model years; and Z4 roadsters from the 2009 model year to present date.</description></item><item><title>BMW M50/M52: Intake Modification</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/m52-intake-modification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/m52-intake-modification/</guid><description>With this modification, your M52B25 or M52B28 engine will make more power. The M52B25 and M52B28 engines can be found in the E36, E39, E38, and in some early E46 models. This is not the easiest modification, but if you are at least a little bit handy, it is not difficult. Some people say that this will gain an additional 20HP, while some say it won’t give you any. I believe that there are power benefits.</description></item><item><title>BMW N54 Tuning &amp; Maintenance Guide</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/bmw-n54-tuning--maintenance-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/bmw-n54-tuning--maintenance-guide/</guid><description>Over the past few years, the N54 twin turbo 3.0 lite inline-6 has gained the reputation of being an easily tunable and powerful engine. With the N54 aging and the increasing number of modifications available, we are bound to begin seeing more blown engines and turbos. Although the block and internals are very strong, the N54 is prone to issues without the proper maintenance and repairs. Whether your N54 is stock or running a large single turbo set up, this guide will ensure your engine is running at its best.</description></item><item><title>BMW Removes Manual Transmission From 5-Series</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/bmw-removes-manual-transmission-from-5-series/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/bmw-removes-manual-transmission-from-5-series/</guid><description>Roughly a month ago, I was on BMW USA’s website and noticed the manual gearbox was removed from the F10 5 series. The standard gearbox is now the 8 speed auto (sigh) or there is the sport automatic transmission for an extra $500. When a manual gearbox is removed from a fine tuned driving instrument, a part of its soul has been removed.Thankfully the manual is still available on the 3 series (probably for a short time) and on the M series line up.</description></item><item><title>BMW Swirl Scratch Removal</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/bmw-swirl-scratch-removal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/bmw-swirl-scratch-removal/</guid><description>Here is how I removed the swirl scratches and replenished the finish on the hood of 540i/6.

This new version looks more like the hood/trunk lid badge. Gone is the gray plastic bezel and in is a nice chrome ring. The plastic feels better, the badge is a hair bigger, and these new components seem to withstand the test of time better.
Objective: Update or refresh the look of your wheels with the new-style BMW wheel center caps.</description></item><item><title>Maintaining a Vintage BMW</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/maintaining-a-vintage-bmw/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/maintaining-a-vintage-bmw/</guid><description>You’ve probably heard about the incredible story of the M1 that was found sitting in a garage in Italy for 34 years. But in case you need a refresher, it’s the 1981 production model that had only clocked 4,600 miles before being put in storage by its owner. Then last year, the vintage car specialists at Mint Classics discovered the automobile in its poor state. Fortunately it wasn’t too late, so now it’s being returned to its former glory.</description></item><item><title>Restoration Project: Alpina B10 V8</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/restoration-project-alpina-b10-v8/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/restoration-project-alpina-b10-v8/</guid><description>After two weeks of a detailed check-up at BMW Dubai (AED 4,000 or $1,100 USD) plus my additional instructions, I came to understand that the core of this car is healthy. The only big mechanical aspects are: front wishbones, rear wheel bearings suspensions (Alpina specific, will cost a fortune as I want genuine OEM only), the rubber disc connecting the gearbox output to the prop-shaft, and the spinning crankshaft joint.</description></item><item><title>Shit E39 Owners Say</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/shit-e39-owners-say/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/shit-e39-owners-say/</guid><description>We thought it may be rather amusing to put together a little video dedicated to BMW E39 owners.

In the garage or shop of any car enthusiast, you’re likely to find dozens of car products. Soaps, tire shines, glass cleaners, leather conditioners, assorted towels, brushes, sponges, etc. We like to spend our weekends polishing our cars, even if they only go back in the garage directly afterwards. For some reason, it’s a therapeutic process. Like any process, there are dozens of ways to go about it.</description></item></channel></rss>
