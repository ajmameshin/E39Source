I was in the downtown area of my community with my grandparents at a concert on our square. During intermission, we always took a little stroll to get some ice cream. This stroll happened to be a tad more expensive, but much more fun. My M5 was poorly backed in to a spot, showing it’s age with the pre-facelift headlights, a gaudy front license plate, and more than a handful of stone chips in the hood and front bumper. There was an orange For Sale sign on the inside of the windshield, displaying the car’s year, make, model, and the owner’s phone number. I snapped a few photos with my iPhone 4, hence the exact aforementioned date and time. My grandparents were a lot less excited about the car than I was.</p></p><p class=read-more><a href=https://www.e39source.com/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5/ class="btn btn-template-main">Continue reading</a></p></div></div></section><section class=post><div class=row><div class=col-md-4><div class=image><a href=https://www.e39source.com/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2011/><img src=/img/IMG_0487.jpeg class=img-responsive alt></a></div></div><div class=col-md-8><h2><a href=https://www.e39source.com/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2011/>2011: The Story: Ryan’s 2000 BMW E39 M5:</a></h2><div class=clearfix><p class=author-category>in

I was on my own. And I found that there was very little quality DIY content available online. After spending years making technology DIYs on YouTube, I toyed with the idea of switching to cars. In 2011, I created E39Source DIYs for the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-WjJgv7AHs">shift knob</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFTOM1-qXmU">parking brake handle</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkLTEcAdEMU">center console trim</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnScPFwnB58">cup-holders</a>, and I replaced a failed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSYNdfjVUro">rear park distance control sensor</a>. Mechanically, I replaced the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O6TjvA_vA">front brake rotors and pads</a>, fixed a squeaky window, and had my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQF6lUmDvOA">parking brake shoes</a> replaced. I also replaced the front bumper, fog lights, grills, and had the hood and front bumper repainted. In December, I bought a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXQ3D9P9g9o">Peake R5/FCX-3</a> code reader. This kept me busy and poor for a long while. I found that 11 codes had been reported to the computer. I let Dave Walter BMW in Akron, Ohio do some diagnostics, and then I spent a month with the car in and out of service getting work done. The thermostat, water pump, spark plugs, O2 sensors, and several different sensors replaced. This removed all but 1 code: code AA, secondary air. This is the one that you don’t want. I let BMW try some solution through the engine to remove the carbon build-up in the system, and it still didn’t totally fix the problem. According to my full service history on the car, the engine had been removed in 2008, and the carbon channels had been drilled out.</p></p><p class=read-more><a href=https://www.e39source.com/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2011/ class="btn btn-template-main">Continue reading</a></p></div></div></section><section class=post><div class=row><div class=col-md-4><div class=image><a href=https://www.e39source.com/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2012/><img src=/img/IMG_0487.jpeg class=img-responsive alt></a></div></div><div class=col-md-8><h2><a href=https://www.e39source.com/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2012/>2012: The Story: Ryan’s 2000 BMW E39 M5:</a></h2><div class=clearfix><p class=author-category>in

I have decided to make this car as nice as I can afford to. That means every screw, every clip, every bracket, every everything has to be present, and in good working condition. They also need to look good. I ordered over 400 new parts for this car this year. It got new OEM style 65 wheels, new tires, chassis braces, instrument cluster bezel, switches, knobs, fan clutch, engine fan, door sills, M-audio subs, front bumper, trim, fog lights, rear bumper, trim, diffuser, facelift steering wheel, a total over-haul in electronics, all exterior door trim, coolant expansion tank, new filters, parking brake rebuild, rear brake overhaul, M3 oil cap, oil return hoses, and all mounting and installation hardware associated with these things. That huge list represents less than 1/4 of the parts replaced. I want this car to look amazing, it deserves to. It was a 7/10 to begin with, but by selling all of the old parts still worth using, I can afford a 9/10. I also installed the Shark Injector software to remove the AA code, and make the car a bit more fun.</p></p><p class=read-more><a href=https://www.e39source.com/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2014/ class="btn btn-template-main">Continue reading</a></p></div></div></section><section class=post><div class=row><div class=col-md-4><div class=image><a href=https://www.e39source.com/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2015/><img src=/img/IMG_0487.jpeg class=img-responsive alt></a></div></div><div class=col-md-8><h2><a href=https://www.e39source.com/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2015/>2015: The Story: Ryan’s 2000 BMW E39 M5:</a></h2><div class=clearfix><p class=author-category>in

I had the new side mirrors painted, rust removed from one rocker panel, and various other minor rust spot corrections. The car is now rust free! I did the brake fluid when new lines were installed, and got fresh coolant after a thermostat replacement. At 188,026 miles now, this car is more capable than any 2003 model I’ve ever seen. A full euro lighting conversion, all OEM parts, a short shift kit, Shark tune, M-audio woofers, SIRIUS XM, aux, upgraded navigation, fresh vitals, etc. 2015 carried on with a ton of improvements: 18mm Eibach rear sway bar, beast power brackets, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lq2tPzdGco">front PDC retrofit</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQbVkcupciM">aluminum pedals</a>, Eisenmann Race 4x76mm axle-back exhaust, fresh Pilot Super Sport tires, an oil change, OE front rotors and Hawk HPS pads, new front calipers, PDR, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqYI074iNRs">seat trims and buttons</a>, and various other hardware and small trim bits. I also replaced all of the interior Titan-line trim. The center console, dashboard trims, door trims, all fresh. The old stuff was in okay condition, but it tends to get glossier with age. The fresh trim set is more of a matte finish, and freshens up the interior quite nicely. Seemingly, right after I ordered the fresh interior trim set, the prices on this stuff skyrocketed. I think I got one of the last sets.</p></p><p class=read-more><a href=https://www.e39source.com/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2015/ class="btn btn-template-main">Continue reading</a></p></div></div></section><section class=post><div class=row><div class=col-md-4><div class=image><a href=https://www.e39source.com/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2016/><img src=/img/IMG_0487.jpeg class=img-responsive alt></a></div></div><div class=col-md-8><h2><a href=https://www.e39source.com/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2016/>2016: The Story: Ryan’s 2000 BMW E39 M5:</a></h2><div class=clearfix><p class=author-category>in

Anything under the car that wasn’t set for at least 100,000 miles was to be rebuilt/replaced.</p><p>The engine work had been going on since January. The heads were sent out to a machine shop to be cleaned, and have new valve seals fitted. The valve clearances were checked, and they were all like new. The block was also sent out for cleaning and a polish. It came back like new too. Anything that is wearable inside the engine was replaced (minus the piston rings). Every seal, gasket, tensioner, washer, bolt, nut, etc. Hundreds of parts were replaced while re-constructing this engine. The VANOS system went to Dr. VANOS for new o-rings, cleaning, testing, and to have the helical gears machined so it’ll be as quiet as possible.</p></p><p class=read-more><a href=https://www.e39source.com/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2016/ class="btn btn-template-main">Continue reading</a></p></div></div></section><section class=post><div class=row><div class=col-md-4><div class=image><a href=https://www.e39source.com/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2017/><img src=/img/IMG_0487.jpeg class=img-responsive alt></a></div></div><div class=col-md-8><h2><a href=https://www.e39source.com/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2017/>2017: The Story: Ryan’s 2000 BMW E39 M5:</a></h2><div class=clearfix><p class=author-category>in

I received several photos of my old engine opened up, and taken apart. After 192,000 miles, the bottom end still looked clean, with no sludge or anything worrisome. The connecting rod bearings certainly showed some wear, but nothing that would have caused catastrophic failure. The new owner even said that the timing chain guides (original) still appeared to be quite strong.
