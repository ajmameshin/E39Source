Usually electrical sensors are the most prominent, annoying, and expensive problems we have with these cars, and this only perpetuates this theory. Own an E39 M5 for long enough, and you’ll end up having to replace the cam sensors.
What is a Camshaft Position Sensor?
Let’s start with a camshaft. Put basically, the camshaft is responsible for opening and closing intake and exhaust valves in a combustion engine.</description></item><item><title>BMW E39 M5: Floor/Trunk Mats</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/trunk-mats/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/trunk-mats/</guid><description>Really Ryan, a post about floor mats?

Somehow, I didn’t kill myself. By 2011, the void of E39 M5 DIY content online made me think ‘If I want to see this content, maybe others would too.’ I decided to spearhead the lack of online content with E39Source. This has allowed me to connect with thousands of fellow E39 (M5) owners. Now after 12+ years of E39 M5 experience, I have come to know this platform quite well. For the first 8 years, I serviced my own vehicle.

I detail the majority of these changes this article. Some of the most noticeable differences are in the lighting elements. The 2001 facelift brought new headlights, fog lights, and tail lights to the E39. This article will detail the upgrade process from 1996-2000 lights to 2001+ lights.
There is a right way and a wrong way to go about this. If you use Ebay to search for E39 headlights and tail lights, you will find several significantly cheaper alternatives to what I recommend using.</description></item><item><title>BMW E39: Facelift Steering Wheel Upgrade</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/facelift-steering-wheel-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/facelift-steering-wheel-upgrade/</guid><description>For 2001, BMW gave the E39 M5 the E46 M3 steering wheel. Before this, it had used the E36 M3’s wheel. The newer wheel looks a lot more modern and feels much more sporty due to it’s thicker girth, and more pronounced side bolsters. The E46 wheel also allows you to finally see both the top of the gauges and the cluster LCD display at the same time! Depending on when your E39 was made, this update process can be super easy, or damn near impossible.</description></item><item><title>BMW E39: HVAC Panel Facelift</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/hvac-panel-facelift/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/hvac-panel-facelift/</guid><description>This is a minor item to facelift, but it was included in the E39 2001 model year refresh nonetheless.

But maintaining a used BMW is another story. After all, the most expensive car you every buy will probably be a cheap BMW. This is a case study of an E39 M5 owner after 9 years and 100,000 miles. So, what did that cost?
1. The operating cost of the car is 53 Cents per mile. The average cost for a large sedan is 56 cents per mile (AAA 2018).</description></item><item><title>E39 M5 Engine Reliability</title><link>https://www.e39source.com/blog/engine-reliability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.e39source.com/blog/engine-reliability/</guid><description>A common topic, S62 longevity.

The E39 M5’s S62 V8 can last 300,000 miles on original components. The S62 can also fail at 40,000 miles.

Its looks, its performance, the way it drives…it has all of the hallmarks of a modern classic. Recently, BMW made the E39’s status official by relocating the E39 chassis from the ‘Current’ parts catalog to the ‘Classic’ or ‘Heritage’ catalog. While this does allow for bragging rights and an inordinate use of “Respect Your Elders” stickers, what does it actually mean for the enthusiasts and owners of these cars?</description></item></channel></rss>
