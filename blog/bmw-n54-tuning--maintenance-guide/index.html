With the N54 aging and the increasing number of modifications available, we are bound to begin seeing more blown engines and turbos. Although the block and internals are very strong, the N54 is prone to issues without the proper maintenance and repairs. Whether your N54 is stock or running a large single turbo set up, this guide will ensure your engine is running at its best.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Basic maintenance/repairs for STOCK N54s:</strong></p><ol><li>Spark Plugs and Ignition Coils.</li></ol><p> </p><p>Spark plugs generally last 30,000+ miles. However, since spark plugs are cheap preventative maintenance I recommend changing them every 25,000 miles. Keeping your spark plugs fresh will reduce the load on the ignition coils, which allows the coils to last longer. Ignition coils will generally last 60,000 miles, but again I recommend replacing them early and stick with 50,000-mile intervals. Why change spark plugs and coils early? These items are cheap basic maintenance and can ensure the longevity of your motor. Old plugs and coils may lead to misfires, which puts additional stress on an engine; if the misfire is enough, it may even lead to a blown motor. Added bonus: keeping these parts new and fresh will ensure your n54 is running at peak performance.</p><p> </p><p>We recommend getting OEM Bosch pugs and coils, we recommend getting them here:</p><p><a href=https://bmwsparkplugs.com/collections/n54/products/bmw-n54-oem-spark-plugs>N54 OEM Bosch High Powered Plugs</a></p><p><a href=https://bmwsparkplugs.com/collections/n54/products/bmw-n54-ignition-coils>N54 OEM Bosch Ignition Coils</a></p><p> </p><ol start=2><li>Fuel Injectors</li></ol><p> </p><p>Given the roughly $1500 repair cost of faulty injectors, this is likely not something “basic” that you want to do as preventative maintenance. Rather, if you’re having misfire issues and neither spark plugs nor coils fix the issue then it’s probably your injectors. The earlier model n54’s (07/08 models) are known to have fuel injector issues. A common symptom is a very rough idle with hiccups and misfires. I had 5 faulty injectors on my 2007 335i with 81k miles at the time (the issue wasn’t noticeable until I changed the old spark plugs).</p><p><a href=https://www.bmwpartsfactory.com/GENUINE-BMW/9/13-53-8-616-079>N54 Genuine BMW Fuel Injectors</a></p><p> </p><ol start=3><li>Oil Change</li></ol><p> </p><p>There is a lot of talk about the oil change interval for this engine. BMW says every 12 months, or 15,000 miles. However, a lot of mechanics and car enthusiasts cringe at the thought of that. Play it safe and change your oil every 6,000-8,000 miles.</p><p> </p><p>We recommend <a href=https://www.bmwpartsfactory.com/LIQUI-MOLY-SPECIAL-TEC-LL/1016/2248>LiquiMoly 5w-30 oil</a>.</p><p> </p><ol start=4><li>Leaking Valve Cover and/or Gasket</li></ol><p> </p><p>A leaking valve cover gasket can cause more issues than most owners realize. When my valve cover gasket was leaking an indy mechanic and two local BMW dealerships told me not to worry about it. However, after blowing my bank #2 turbo two times, I realized something wasn’t right. After extensive research (and talking with BMW’s head mechanic in Colorado), I found this information: A leaking valve cover/gasket leads to over-pressurization of the crankcase, which in turn can cause your PCV (positive crankcase ventilation) valve to leak. Sure enough, the PCV vents to the bank #2 turbo. If you blow your bank #2 turbo due to too much pressure, look no further than your valve cover and PCV valve. However, if you notice an oil leak from the valve cover area it is best to get it replaced before any other issues arise. The PCV valve is cheap, so always replace it when working on the valve cover.</p><p> </p><ol start=5><li>Cooling System (Water Pump, Radiator, etc)</li></ol><p> </p><p>This has always been a weak point for BMW’s. Cooling is essential to the life of an engine. Again, this may not be something you want to do preventatively, but if you notice any signs of overheating pull over as soon as you can. Water pumps rarely last more than 100k miles on the N54, so if you’re planning on doing a long road trip or can’t afford to be late to work, this is good preventative maintenance around the 90,000-mile mark.</p><p> </p><ol start=6><li>Intake Valve Walnut Blasting</li></ol><p> </p><p>Due to the fact the n54 is direct injected these engines will see some carbon deposits and build up on the intake valves. Dirty intake valves can cause a rough idle as well as misfire. By cleaning the intake valves every 60,000 miles you will reduce misfires and ensure your n54 is running at its best. You can also get an OCC (oil catch can) which will collect some of the oil blow by and reduce carbon build up.</p><p> </p><p>The above maintenance and repairs encompass the basics of ensuring your engine internals and turbos are running at their prime. Of course there are many other things that may go wrong with your n54, but one thing remains true. If you actively prevent/reduce misfires, the engine is receiving proper lubrication and cooling, and there are no pressure leaks then the turbos and engine internals should last a long time.</p><p> </p><p>So to recap maintenance intervals for a stock N54:</p><p> </p><p>Spark Plugs: 20-25k miles
Ignition Coils: 40-50k miles
Oil Changes: 6-8k miles
Water Pump: ~100k miles as preventative maintenance
Walnut Blast: 50-60k miles</p><p> </p><p><strong>Maintenance and Repairs for a tuned/modded N54:</strong></p><p>The basics of ensuring the longevity of your engine remain the same on a modified N54. Prevent misfires, keep the engine cool and properly lubricated, and keep internal pressures down. I am going to touch on what I mentioned above for stock n54’s, but I’ll keep it short so we can get to the fun part: modifications.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Maintenance Intervals:</strong></p><p> </p><p>Spark Plugs: 10-15k miles</p><p> </p><p>The less modifications you have the longer you can wait. My 335i is full bolt-on running 30% e85 and I change mine every 12k miles.</p><p> </p><p>Ignition Coils: 20-30k miles</p><p> </p><p>As mentioned above, keeping spark plugs fresh will allow coils to last longer. However, at higher power levels you will certainly burn through coils much faster.</p><p> </p><p>Oil Change: 6-8k miles</p><p> </p><p>This doesn’t change much. However, spirited drivers (probably most people with tuned n54’s) should stick to the lower end of the interval.</p><p> </p><p>I am going to mention the Valve Cover/Gasket and PCV issue again for those who skipped right to second section of this guide.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Valve Cover/Gasket Leak and PCV Valve</strong></p><p> </p><p>I cannot stress the importance of this enough, especially because the general conception is that this is not an issue that can potentially cause serious turbo issues. I blew my bank #2 turbo twice due to a leaking valve cover gasket (both times on the 3rd to 4th gear shift at roughly 95mph). When your valve cover is leaking it causes an over-pressurization of the crankcase. The PCV Valve (positive crankcase ventilation valve) can begin to leak due to over-pressurization of the crankcase. That PCV valve dumps any extra pressure into the bank #2 turbo. This is incredibly important when pushing the stock turbos, or any turbos towards their limits. When I was running 17psi with the JB4 on Map 5, my turbos ran strong. As soon as I flashed to the MHD e85 tune and began running 19psi I blew two bank 2 turbos within 1400 miles. That’s because my bank 2 turbo was running 19psi + any additional pressure dumped into the turbo from the crankcase.</p><p> </p><p><strong>N54 Modifications: Your Guide to Making More Power Reliably</strong></p><p> </p><p>Finally, on to the fun part! How can someone tune and modify the N54 to have double the stock horsepower while increasing reliability and longevity? Keeping in mind the above points (prevent misfires, promote engine cooling and lubrication, and reduce internal pressures) lets move on to some modifications for the N54.</p><p> </p><p>Lets briefly review the common mods and consumer options for an n54 and their estimated power gains (keep in mind these numbers can vary a lot). This is not an exhaustive list of options and I would recommend researching the different brands before making a decision.</p><p> </p><ol><li><p>Tune (JB4, COBB, Procede) à 60-100hp</p></li><li><p>Downpipes (VRSF, AA, COBB) à 10-20hp</p></li><li><p>DCI (BMS) à 10-20hp</p></li><li><p>FMIC (VRSF, AA, ETS, COBB) à 10-15hp</p></li><li><p>Exhaust (too many options) à 5-10hp</p></li></ol><p> </p><p>Once you have those bolt-ons you’re n54 will be making roughly 380-420whp, the equivalent of close to 450hp or more at the crank. So now that you are making 50% more horsepower than stock, what next?</p><p> </p><ol><li>E85 Fuel Mixture</li></ol><p> </p><p>If you have access to E85 this is probably the single best thing you could do to your modified n54. E85 is a higher octane than any pump fuel with an octane rating of roughly 105. Higher-octane fuels aid in knock suppression and can help prevent misfires. Also, normal gasoline has a stoichiometric air fuel ratio of 14.7:1, and e85 has 9.8:1. This means that you need more fuel per part of air in the cylinder, which promotes engine cooling (e85 molecules absorb heat as they transform from liquid to gas in the cylinder). So e85 helps with many things that prevent the longevity of an engine. It helps cool the engine and reduces knocks and misfires. Make sure you do a lot of research before running e85.</p><p> </p><ol start=2><li>Meth Injection</li></ol><p> </p><p>Spraying meth into the intake is a great way to reduce IAT’s, increase performance, and reduce internal engine temperatures. A properly set up meth kit it essential to the safety of the engine. A dual nozzle meth injection kit is recommended and proper maintenance and cleaning of the meth system is essential. This is also a mod that requires a lot of additional research before deciding whether or not its something for you.</p><p> </p><ol start=3><li>Upgraded Oil Cooler/Dual Oil Cooler</li></ol><p> </p><p>The stock oil cooler found on some N54’s (a lot of n54’s have no oil cooler) is very small. Upgrading to a larger unit or adding an additional oil cooler will significantly help keep oil temps down. After spirited driving the N54 can see oil temps of 250-260 degrees F, where an upgraded oil cooler can reduce temps to 230 or lower. If your N54 has NO oil cooler, then this is an important modification to keep in mind when increasing your N54’s power and torque.</p><p> </p><ol start=4><li>Upgraded Inlets/Outlets</li></ol><p> </p><p>Larger inlets and outlets will allow the turbos to move air more efficiently thereby increasing horsepower and reducing stress on the turbochargers.</p><p> </p><p>Click here for more N54 Tuning Guides: <a href=https://bmwtuning.co/>BMW Tuning</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>What about the BMW N55?</strong></p><p>The BMW N55 is the successor of the N54 engine. In 2011, it replaced the N54 in the 135i, 335i, and 535i, and was later featured in the new 235i, M2, and 435i. They key difference is that the N55 is a single-turbocharged engine, compared to the twin-turbocharged N54. While the N55 has been deemed less tune-able than the N54, you can still achieve sizeable power gains at a relatively cheap price!</p><p> </p><p>Shopping for <a href=https://bmwpartsfactory.com/>OEM BMW Parts</a>?
