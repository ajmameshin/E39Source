It’ll be long, detailed, and full of links to YouTube videos and website articles that I have written through the process. This is nearly a decade in the making, after all.
Sunday, July 18th, 2010. 6:42pm. The corner of Village Way and Library Street, in the midwestern town of Hudson, Ohio. I was in the downtown area of my community with my grandparents at a concert on our square.</description></item><item><title>2011: The Story: Ryan’s 2000 BMW E39 M5:</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2011/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2011/</guid><description>2011
By this point, I had learned that I could not afford to have any service/maintenance/upgrades carried out through BMW dealerships. I was on my own. And I found that there was very little quality DIY content available online. After spending years making technology DIYs on YouTube, I toyed with the idea of switching to cars. In 2011, I created E39Source DIYs for the shift knob, parking brake handle, center console trim, cup-holders, and I replaced a failed rear park distance control sensor.</description></item><item><title>2012: The Story: Ryan’s 2000 BMW E39 M5:</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2012/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2012/</guid><description>2012
Fa t n eat b lts. My cluster’s pixels were committing suicide by the day. It turns out, somebody saw one of my videos showing the problem on YouTube. He sent me a message, telling me how to get BMW of North America to help fix the problem for less than the cost of a whole new cluster. This guy had a 2003 525iA do the same thing, and he is now partly responsible for this website, and one of my closest friends.</description></item><item><title>2013: The Story: Ryan’s 2000 BMW E39 M5:</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2013/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2013/</guid><description>2013
Navigation. In the 2001 model year, BMW upgraded the E39’s navigation display to a 16:9 widescreen instrument. The computer also got upgraded. I took this a step further, and bought a MKIV computer in addition to 16:9 display. Big upgrade for this car, DVD readability and all!
I spent much of 2013 fixing the larger issues. They weren’t even large, but they bothered me. I replaced intake camshaft sensors, installed new floor matts and white fog bulbs, changed transmission and differentialoils, replaced control arms and tie rods, added LED license plate lights, had some more minor rust marks removed, changed shifter bushings, added a UUC Evo 3 short shift kit, replaced the FSU and blower motor and replaced my mass air flow sensors.</description></item><item><title>2014 BMW M5 and M6 to Receive Upgraded Competition Package</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/2014-bmw-m5-and-m6-to-receive-upgraded-competition-package/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/2014-bmw-m5-and-m6-to-receive-upgraded-competition-package/</guid><description>BMW is testing a new version of the F10 M5, which is expected to be launched this summer as a 2014 model.

Things will get crazy this year. I have decided to make this car as nice as I can afford to. That means every screw, every clip, every bracket, every everything has to be present, and in good working condition. They also need to look good. I ordered over 400 new parts for this car this year. It got new OEM style 65 wheels, new tires, chassis braces, instrument cluster bezel, switches, knobs, fan clutch, engine fan, door sills, M-audio subs, front bumper, trim, fog lights, rear bumper, trim, diffuser, facelift steering wheel, a total over-haul in electronics, all exterior door trim, coolant expansion tank, new filters, parking brake rebuild, rear brake overhaul, M3 oil cap, oil return hoses, and all mounting and installation hardware associated with these things.</description></item><item><title>2015: The Story: Ryan’s 2000 BMW E39 M5:</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2015/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2015/</guid><description>2015
Spring 2015 started with body work. I had the new side mirrors painted, rust removed from one rocker panel, and various other minor rust spot corrections. The car is now rust free! I did the brake fluid when new lines were installed, and got fresh coolant after a thermostat replacement. At 188,026 miles now, this car is more capable than any 2003 model I’ve ever seen. A full euro lighting conversion, all OEM parts, a short shift kit, Shark tune, M-audio woofers, SIRIUS XM, aux, upgraded navigation, fresh vitals, etc.</description></item><item><title>2016: The Story: Ryan’s 2000 BMW E39 M5:</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2016/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2016/</guid><description>2016
In March of 2016, the roads cleared enough for me to take the car into the shop. The plans had grown though. Not only was it getting a rebuilt 2002 engine and 2003 differential, but a full driveline, brake, gear linkage, and suspension refresh. Anything under the car that wasn’t set for at least 100,000 miles was to be rebuilt/replaced.
The engine work had been going on since January. The heads were sent out to a machine shop to be cleaned, and have new valve seals fitted.</description></item><item><title>2017: The Story: Ryan’s 2000 BMW E39 M5:</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2017/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2017/</guid><description>2017

My original engine now in New York.
I got bored enough in January to reach out to the new owner of my old S62, and see what he had found out with it. He bought my used engine to install in a project car of his. He told me a year ago that he planned to rebuild it before installing it in another car. I received several photos of my old engine opened up, and taken apart.</description></item><item><title>2018: The Story: Ryan’s 2000 BMW E39 M5:</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2018/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2018/</guid><description>2018
For April Fools day, Kennan had the great idea to film an E39Source Intro- in the voice and grandeur of US President Donald J. Tump. You have to see this video!

The April Fools video was a HUUUUGGEE success.

E39Source is now an LLC, with a brick and mortar location. We rented a 3,500 square foot shop up in Escondido, 30 miles north of San Diego. We had two lifts installed, and got a badass set of tools. You can read more about what E39Source is doing now here.

This first winter in California was ‘rainy’ by California standards. That meant that my dad’s 1998 Ferrari 355 wasn’t driven as much over the winter as it usually does.</description></item><item><title>2020: The Story: Ryan’s 2000 BMW E39 M5:</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2020/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2020/</guid><description>2020
I am now finally using this car for what I have been building it for for years! I wanted a reliable, daily-drivable M5 for when I got to California. It took me nearly a decade to build that car, and now I can finally use it. From 2014-2018, I drove the car around 3,500 miles per year. In 2019, I logged over 9,000 miles, and loved every one of them!</description></item><item><title>2021: The Story: Ryan’s 2000 BMW E39 M5:</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2021/</guid><description>2021
As the E39Source, LLC service business gains more momentum, I started having the opportunity to work with some very special and unique BMWs (and their owners!) This car is nearly my identical twin; a gorgeous Silverstone/Silverstone 2001 M5. We completed loads of driveline, suspension, and cosmetic improvements on this car, and delivered it to a very happy customer in late January. Per customer request, I thoroughly test-drove this car until we were happy with it’s drivability and new feature functionality.</description></item><item><title>2022: The Story: Ryan’s 2000 BMW E39 M5:</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2022/</guid><description>2022
We pick up 2022 while still waiting for the brake calipers to return from being refurbished. I took this opportunity to drop the exhaust and replace the various heat shields around and above the exhaust system. Mine were dirty, crusty, and had some of the mounting holes washed out due to aluminum corrosion. In order to remove one of the shields, the driveshaft had to come out. I noted a slight tick from the center support bearing, so I replaced that as well.</description></item><item><title>Alex’s 1999 BMW E39 540i/6 Introduction</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/alexs-1999-bmw-e39-540i6-indroduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/alexs-1999-bmw-e39-540i6-indroduction/</guid><description>There comes a point in time when people decide that they want to make a change in life.

My name is Andrew, and I didn’t start out with my current M5, but rather another BMW: my mother’s 2003 E53 X5. It has the 3.0 liter M54 motor, and a religious service history from the dealer/independent specialists so I would never be let down. It took me until halfway through my senior year in high school and I was using the X5’s utility to the max.</description></item><item><title>Andrew’s New Benz!</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/andrews-new-benz/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/andrews-new-benz/</guid><description>My past BMW’s were fun cars. I had a great time driving them, and I learned a lot fixing them. However, they got a bit repetitive after having cars so similar: the E53 X5, E36 318ti, and the E36 328i. These all shared so much in common that I could go through the motions to change out a thermostat or replace an oil filter housing gasket with my eyes closed.</description></item><item><title>Auxiliary Input Kit Installation (Non-Nav)</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/auxiliary-input-kit-installation-non-nav/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/auxiliary-input-kit-installation-non-nav/</guid><description>This article will go over the required parts and steps to install a hard-wired factory BMW auxiliary input kit to your E39 5-series without factory navigation.

As new, enthusiastic owners buy up BMWs, we often like to do a little maintenance. Replace some trim here, a shift knob there, et cetera. After years of use, the somewhat-cheap rubber knobs really deteriorate. They look scuffed, and feel slushy. Replacing them can improve the feel of your radio and navigation system!

In most cases, your culprit is a small hood security switch in the engine bay that takes no more than a few minutes to replace!
Depending on which BMW model you own, you may have a ‘clown nose’ red light on your rear-view mirror. When you lock your car, this light should flash, every ~3 seconds or so. If the car thinks there is a fault in the alarm system (hood sensor failure) the light will flash rapidly, maybe 2 times per second or more immediately after locking.</description></item><item><title>BMW Answers Tesla with a “Green” Supercar</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/bmw-answers-tesla-with-a-green-supercar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/bmw-answers-tesla-with-a-green-supercar/</guid><description>Up till now, Tesla has had the market for high-end electric cars pretty much to itself.

If I fit in it, then I know what to look for.</description></item><item><title>Christian’s 1999 540i Introduction</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/christians-1999-540i-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/christians-1999-540i-introduction/</guid><description>As far back as I can remember I have been obsessed with cars, and most recently that obsession has been channeled to my 1999 540i. My passion for cars is definitely in my family’s blood. My grandpa had a very strong interest in cars, some of which are some of the most beautiful cars from the 20th century in my opinion. These cars included a 1969 Signal Orange Porsche 911E, 1958 Blue Jaguar XK-140 convertible, 1968 Jaguar E-type convertible in Tan, and a 1966 Lincoln Continental convertible in Black with the suicide doors.</description></item><item><title>Christian’s 2000 BMW E46 330ci</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/christains-2000-bmw-e46-330ci/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/christains-2000-bmw-e46-330ci/</guid><description>Christian’s family had tried a BMW before- and it didn’t go well. What was so terrible about that first BMW? What is it about this E46 330ci that changed things? This is the story of Christian’s first car- a 2000 E46 finished in Oxford Green metallic.
I never thought I would say this, but I bought a BMW! Let me give that statement some context. BMW’s don’t have the best reputation in my family.</description></item><item><title>Colton’s 2001 BMW 540i Introduction</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/coltons-2001-bmw-540i-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/coltons-2001-bmw-540i-introduction/</guid><description>On Thursday, September 6th, 2012 at 5:08am I turned the key to the first ignition slot on what would turn into one of the biggest decisions of my life thus far. Let me start from the beginning. I’ve always been interested in automobiles, ever since I was a young boy. I was the boy who had a box full of matchbox cars which I would drive around on the floor for hours imagining different scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Compromise – Updates with Andrew and His 2000 M5</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/compromise-updates-with-andrew-and-his-2000-m5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/compromise-updates-with-andrew-and-his-2000-m5/</guid><description>I’ve had my M5 for about seven months now, but I have only driven it 2500 miles. That is plenty of time to get familiar with my vehicle, but not enough to determine it’s reliability. For example, when I went to top off the tank before putting my M5 back into storage, it threw an SES code on the cluster. I plugged in my cheap-o generic OBDII scanner, and it came up with a P1526 and P0022 code, “A” Camshaft Position Actuator Control Open Circuit Bank 2 and “A” Camshaft Position – Timing over-retarded (Bank 2) respectively.</description></item><item><title>Danny’s Imola 2000 BMW M5</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/dannys-imola-2000-bmw-m5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/dannys-imola-2000-bmw-m5/</guid><description>I was contemplating doing a video of the car and recorded one only to realize that my spoken English isn’t what it once was (Swedish sing-a-song-accent haha) so I’ll make a written post of my recently acquired M5 instead. I found out about the car a few months ago via a friend and I loosely knew the previous owner before as I were childhood friends with his brother.
PO bought the car in oct 2014 and drove it the 100 miles south from Stockholm to his home, and a week later a 500 mile round trip to get the pixels fixed, that it, he hasn’t driven it any more since.</description></item><item><title>Daryl’s 2001 525i Introduction</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/daryls-2001-525i-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/daryls-2001-525i-introduction/</guid><description>G’day from sunny Brisbane, Queensland Australia!

I could write a book about this, but I’ll try not to here. I’ve been an M5 owner for over 12 years and 85,000 miles now. Over the past 4 years, me and my term have serviced hundreds of E39 M5s. The E39 M5’s S62 V8 can last 300,000 miles on original components. The S62 can also fail at 40,000 miles. Thankfully, there seem to be many more instances of higher miles than lower.</description></item><item><title>E39 Production Changes</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/production-changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/production-changes/</guid><description>The BMW E39 5-series was produced from 09/1995-06/2003 for the 1996-2003 model years. In September of 2000, for the 2001 model year, BMW gave the E39 a facelift. This means that the E39 chassis was updated, renewed both technologically and aesthetically for a few more years of production. Even outside of the big 2001 facelift, things with the E39 changed each year. This article will summarize the changes BMW made to US-spec vehicles throughout the production run.</description></item><item><title>Fabien’s 2001 BMW Alpina B10 Introduction</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/fabiens-2001-bmw-alpina-b10-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/fabiens-2001-bmw-alpina-b10-introduction/</guid><description>The BMW E39 Alpina B10 V8 is based on the 540i.

The Alpina documentation specific to this car states power output to be 355BHP and 480 Nm (354 lb/ft).

I bought this car in June of this year from a guy in Minnesota. I found the car on Craigslist, and bought it for $6,500, which was a great deal. I originally wanted an M5, but they were out of my price range, so I started looking for a 540i. After some research, I found out that the V8s are a pain to repair, and the MPGs are awful, so I decided to go for a 530i.</description></item><item><title>Jackson’s 2002 BMW E39 M5 Introduction</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/jacksons-2002-bmw-e39-m5-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/jacksons-2002-bmw-e39-m5-introduction/</guid><description>Hello everyone, I hope winter is going well so far!

While there are many other remarkable performance sedans out there (E28 M5, E34 M5, W211 E55, C5 RS6, and countless others), the E39 has held a special place in my heart from a young age. Not many other sedans have aged as gracefully and the E39 M5 represents the perfect blend between past and present in the M5 lineage.</description></item><item><title>Maintaining a Vintage BMW</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/maintaining-a-vintage-bmw/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/maintaining-a-vintage-bmw/</guid><description>You’ve probably heard about the incredible story of the M1 that was found sitting in a garage in Italy for 34 years.

Then last year, the vintage car specialists at Mint Classics discovered the automobile in its poor state.

After I turned four, I would point to cars on the road and ask my dad what they were. His limited automotive knowledge meant that every SUV was a Jeep to me; everything else was a mishmash. Through clipping pictures of nice cars out of magazines, collecting Hot Wheels sized cars, and reading the undercarriage for the label, I started to form a vague understanding of what I was seeing on the road.</description></item><item><title>Shit E39 Owners Say</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/shit-e39-owners-say/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/shit-e39-owners-say/</guid><description>We thought it may be rather amusing to put together a little video dedicated to BMW E39 owners.

It starts 13 years ago… with a different kind of BMW than the one that I now own. One that, in my opinion, is by far the finest thing to come from Germany in a very long time… The E30 M3. I owned that icon for 11 memorable years, and still marvel that I was fortunate enough to own something so pure in it’s DNA, something that rewarded your driver input, and never punished you when you got it wrong.</description></item><item><title>The Ultimate Car Detailing: Zaino</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-ultimate-car-detailing-zaino/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/the-ultimate-car-detailing-zaino/</guid><description>It’s a guy thing. In the garage or shop of any car enthusiast, you’re likely to find dozens of car products.

For some reason, it’s a therapeutic process.

Its looks, its performance, the way it drives…it has all of the hallmarks of a modern classic. Recently, BMW made the E39’s status official by relocating the E39 chassis from the ‘Current’ parts catalog to the ‘Classic’ or ‘Heritage’ catalog. While this does allow for bragging rights and an inordinate use of “Respect Your Elders” stickers, what does it actually mean for the enthusiasts and owners of these cars?</description></item></channel></rss>
