I wanted a reliable, daily-drivable M5 for when I got to California. It took me nearly a decade to build that car, and now I can finally use it. From 2014-2018, I drove the car around 3,500 miles per year. In 2019, I logged over 9,000 miles, and loved every one of them!</p><p> </p><p>The biggest job of 2020 so far has bee the automatic headlight retrofit. I filmed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtTmpF87bgc">video</a>, and wrote an E39Source <a href=https://e39source.com/archives/4395>article</a>. It’s almost impossible to tell that my M5 is not a 2003 at this point. The color code and VIN tag will forever give it away, and I’m more than okay with that.</p><p> </p><p><img src=https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_0060.png alt="Alt text"></p><p>Automatic headlight retrofit.</p><p> </p><p>The next job was wireless charging. That’s right, wireless charging. I love being at a point where I can spend my time on fun and functional modifications like this, instead of rebuilding the vital systems. I set mine up to charge my phone wirelessly from the center console tray, where I usually store my phone while driving. I hooked up the wireless charging power to the eject box 18-pin connector, so it’s completely plug-and-play and switched with the key (no battery drain). Wireless charging is not the fastest charging method, but it offers a great way to prevent your phone from losing power while streaming navigation or bluetooth audio. I have found that in my ~17 minute commute to work, I can gain about 10% battery.</p><p> </p><p><img src=https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_7321.png alt="Alt text"></p><p>Wireless charging pad.</p><p> </p><p>For years, I had been using the Ebay copies of the navigation DVDs. They worked fine, and cost $20 vs $150. However, with an increasing number of reports coming out about the bootleg DVDs killing the navigation computer’s lasers, I decided to buy a Genuine BMW copy of the 2015 (latest available) nav DVD set. I did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpyPbi8tWC4">PSA video</a> on this. 2022 update: these are currently NLA! Good timing on my part in 2020.</p><p> </p><p><img src=https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_0445.png alt="Alt text"></p><p>Genuine BMW 2015 navigation DVD set.</p><p> </p><p><img src=https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_5439.png alt="Alt text"></p><p>A beautiful January day in San Diego.</p><p> </p><p><img src=https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_1570.png alt="Alt text"></p><p> </p><p>After having two clients/friends lose their E39 M5s due to fires within a few months, I decided both proactive and reactive measures should be put in place. Fires on E39s are generally caused by one of two things. Firstly, aftermarket amps and (poorly crafted) aftermarket wiring/modifications can cause a fire. Secondly and more commonly, the two short brake hoses under the hood at the ABS module are known to fail after many miles and thermal (heat) cycles. If one of these hoses ruptures, brake fluid will splash down onto the hot exhaust manifold on cylinder bank 1, usually starting a fire. My proactive measure was to replace the brake lines (all six, including the ones at each caliper) with stainless steel lines; which I had already done back in 2014. I plan to replace them again next time the valve cover is of (access to these lines is much easier without the valve cover in the way). My reactive plan installs a fire extinguisher in the cabin. I chose the <a href=https://elementfire.com/products/element-e50>Element E50 extinguisher</a> due to it’s compact size and ability to extinguish both chemical/fuel and electrical fires. I removed my front driver’s seat to install some plastic brackets to house the extinguisher. At this time, I replaced the plastic bracket/door near the seat’s electrical connection as well, as it had been broken since I’ve owned the car. Somehow, my seats have never had the seat twist issue, so I left that alone… for now. I now have an easy-to-use 50-second discharge extinguisher at my fingertips! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrJbNPkcWto">Video here</a>.</p><p> </p><p><img src=https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_2547-1206x1536.jpeg alt="Alt text"></p><p>Driver’s seat removed with fire extinguisher installed. I have since painted the yellow plastic caps black so they are all but invisible.</p><p> </p><p>It’s time to do some detailing. In the past, I have annually washed, clayed, and waxed my M5 using Zaino’s show-car polishes. This has become both a very time consuming and out-dated process. Running the entirety of the service side of E39Source, I simply don’t have two or three days to devote to car detailing anymore. Thankfully, I have a new local friend who specializes in high end detailing! Kevin works for <a href=https://www.elitefinishdetailing.com/>Elite Finish</a> here in San Diego, and advised that we strip off the existing waxes, compound and polish the paint, and follow that up with a C-Quartz ceramic coating in place of the wax. During this service, I also had my side mirrors re-filmed as the film I had installed in Ohio never adhered well to the curvature of the side mirrors. Kevin’s technicians and service is second to none. Here are the results!</p><p> </p><p><img src=https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_2599-1536x1112.jpeg alt="Alt text"></p><p><img src=https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_2598-1536x1098.jpeg alt="Alt text"></p><p><img src=https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_1550-1536x998.jpeg alt="Alt text"></p><p><img src=https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_1563-1536x1005.jpeg alt="Alt text"></p><p><img src=https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_1569-1536x998.jpeg alt="Alt text"></p><p><img src=https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_1571-1536x921.jpeg alt="Alt text"></p><p><img src=https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_1547-1536x989.jpeg alt="Alt text"></p><p><img src=https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_1538-1536x1013.jpeg alt="Alt text"></p><p> </p><p>In September, I was honored to have my M5 chosen by automotive YouTube legend <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/DougDeMuro>Doug DeMuro</a> for a review! He came up to our San Diego based shop and took an afternoon to review my E39 M5 and it’s many quirks and features. You can view that video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P-cNnBFbGc">here</a>.</p><p> </p><p><img src=https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_4341.jpeg alt="Alt text"></p><p>Doug seems unsure about my cheeky plate.</p><p> </p><p>Trunk tools. I’ve wanted to completely fill out my trunk tool kit forever, and I was finally given an opportunity from a viewer in Germany to buy an original BMW polishing cloth! This elusive item has been NLA (no longer available) for years, so it was exciting to finally have the opportunity to purchase one. My car came with most tools when I acquired it; I have simply had to add the 10mm socket, spark plug wrench, warning triangle, and the blue polishing cloth. As far as I know, none of these items were included with the M5 from factory (in the DE93 North American market, anyways). Here’s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAFbXs2RvZk">E39Source video</a> about completing the trunk tools.</p><p> </p><p><img src=https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_4361-1536x1089.jpeg alt="Alt text"></p><p> </p><p>California: home sweet home. After my Ohio e-check (emissions) certificate expired, I was forced to register the vehicle here in California. I passed the state’s SMOG inspection, ordered custom plates (incoming… in 6 months), and was issued a generic set of California plates for the meantime. Pretty cool seeing California tags on this car.</p><p> </p><p><img src=https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_1350-1536x1152.jpeg alt="Alt text"></p><p><img src=https://e39source.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_1351-1536x1152.jpeg alt="Alt text"></p><p> </p><p>There are no photos to accompany this work, but my last investment this year was replacing both lower cabin air intake boxes, the HVAC intake snorkels, and the cabin air filters. These plastics had become brittle already, and were due for a refresh.</p><p> </p><p><strong>2020 Summary:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtTmpF87bgc">Automatic headlight retrofit</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpyPbi8tWC4">Genuine BMW navigation disk</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHsWjQP84IM">Wireless charging</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrJbNPkcWto">Fire extinguisher</a></p><p>Elite Finish polishing, ceramic coating</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P-cNnBFbGc">Doug DeMuro review</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAFbXs2RvZk">Finish trunk tool kit</a></p><p>California registration</p><p>Cabin intake boxes, filters, and HVAC snorkels</p><p> </p><p><a href=/E39Source/blog/the-story-ryans-200-bmw-e39-m5-2021/>NEXT PAGE</a></p><p> </p></div><div id=comments><div id=disqus_thread></div><script>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//devcows.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></div></div><div class=col-md-3><div class="panel panel-default sidebar-menu"><div class=panel-heading><h3 class=panel-title>Search</h3></div><div class=panel-body><form action=//google.com/search method=get accept-charset=UTF-8 role=search><div class=input-group><input type=search name=q class=form-control placeholder=Search>
