text: "I cannot say enough good about Ryan and his business, E39 source. So happy with his expertise and ability to treat a car correctly. He is the foremost in knowledge about all things related to the e39 m5. I had him do a PPI and then work on my recent purchase to get it in tip top shape. Not only is he knowledgeable, but he is fairly priced and that makes the decision easy to take your precious m5 to him and nobody else! Thank you Ryan. It was a pleasure doing business with you! - JEFF FENN"
