text: "I’ve had the pleasure working with Ryan at E39 source on both my E39 M5 and E46 M3. His craftsmanship is next to none! He is the best in the business. He will take care of your car like his own and that is priceless. His ability to rejuvenate your car is like a time machine going back in time. I could’ve easily taken my car to my local BMW dealer, which is less than five minutes away, but I’d rather ship my car to him any day of the week as I know he will get it done right the first time with great attention to detail. Thank you, Ryan. - SEAN P. NIKRAVAN"
