| ![img](../img/AboutPicRyan_resized.png) | Ryan Schultz's love of cars started at a young age, thanks to the influence from his grandfather and father back in his home state of Ohio. In 2003, Ryan’s father Gary purchased a BMW 530i, and thus began his love for BMW and the E39 platform. In 2010, Ryan acquired his 2000 Silverstone M5 - his first car.  Unable to afford costly dealership service, he quickly realized he needed to be able to perform his own service and restoration work.  After earning his Business Management degree from Kent State University in 2016, he fulfilled his life-long dream of moving to San Diego to immerse himself in Southern-California car culture and establish E39Source as a brick-and-mortar operation dedicated to exceptional BMW service.  He is an active member in the BMW CCA and serves on the Board of Directors for the San Diego Region of the Ferrari Owners Club. Ryan’s pursuit of perfection and inordinately high attention to detail has become the very backbone of what E39Source is today. |

| Alan Lopes is the lead technician at E39Source. He is a true car enthusiast and a huge BMW fan who has been working on cars since the age of 17.  Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, he moved to California in 2017 to escape the city life and embrace the palm trees and sunshine.  The vibrant car culture in California was another compelling reason for his relocation, and he is now living the dream!  Alan currently owns an early model BMW E30 5-speed, which he acquired from the original owner here in California and continues to restore in his spare time.   | ![img](../img/Alan_Lopes_Pic_resized-2.png) |
