| ![img](../img/AboutPicRyan_resized.png) | Ryan Schultz's love of cars started at a young age, thanks to the influence from his grandfather and father back in his home state of Ohio. In 2003, Ryan’s father Gary purchased a BMW 530i, and thus began his love for BMW and the E39 platform. In 2010, Ryan acquired his 2000 Silverstone M5 - his first car.  Unable to afford costly dealership service, he quickly realized he needed to be able to perform his own service and restoration work.  After earning his Business Management degree from Kent State University in 2016, he fulfilled his life-long dream of moving to San Diego to immerse himself in Southern-California car culture and establish E39Source as a brick-and-mortar operation dedicated to exceptional BMW service.  He is an active member in the BMW CCA and serves on the Board of Directors for the San Diego Region of the Ferrari Owners Club. Ryan’s pursuit of perfection and inordinately high attention to detail has become the very backbone of what E39Source is today. |
