E39Source was founded in September, 2011 in Hudson, Ohio, and was inspired by the significant void of quality online BMW E39 content. Co-founder Ryan Schultz acquired his 2000 M5 in July, 2010, and has been creating informational and educational content since. In 2018, Ryan and E39Source re-located to San Diego, California where they currently use their brick-and-mortar facility to provide world-class BMW service and support.
