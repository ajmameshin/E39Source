BMW is testing a new version of the F10 M5, which is expected to be launched this summer as a 2014 model.  It will continue to be offered with its 560-hp, twin-turbo, 4.4-liter V-8, but there will also be an optional performance pack- called the Competition Package, which will consist of several upgrades to the current M5.

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

The output of the higher-performance M5 and M6 models will rise from 560 to 575 horsepower.  In addition, both models should receive distinct wheels, black exhaust tips, a revised suspension which will be tuned in favor of a sportier ride with crisper handling, and a more direct steering ratio.

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

With the upgrade of 15 horsepower, the M5 and M6 models that are equipped with the Competition package are essentially just as powerful as the Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG  and its CLS derivative.  I expect the full details to surface from Munich in the coming months, but buyers should expect to pay a hefty premium over the current M5 and M6 base prices, which start at $90,200 and $82,400, respectively.  Below is some footage of the new M5’s lap on the Nürburgring Nordschleife.
