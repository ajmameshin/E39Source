An easy and affordable way to modernize the rear of your BMW is to update your license plate lights.  Prior to ~2011, BMW had used very yellow and dim lights to illuminate the rear tag.   These days they’re using significantly brighter LEDs that produce a very crisp and white colored light.  I installed these lights into my 2000 M5, and have been happy with the results.  They do NOT trigger a ‘check warning’ on the dash.

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

**Objective:** Update rear look of your BMW with brighter and whiter license plate lighting.

**Parts required:**

LED license plate light modules.  Search [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.Xbmw+led+license+plate+lights&_nkw=bmw+led+license+plate+lights&_sacat=0&_from=R40) for BMW ____ (model) LED license plate lights.  I can’t put the actual link because listings end frequently and these links change.

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

**Tools Required:**

Flat-head screwdriver.

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

**Cost:**  ~$30

**Difficulty:**  Easy

**Time Required:**  5-10 minutes

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

**Procedure:**

1. At the trunk lid, take a look at the existing lights.  Notice a small slot on the left side of each light, this is where the screw driver is inserted.  Put the flat head in, and slide the light to the right side.  Both the left and right license plate light should slide to the right.  Be careful applying force with your screwdriver around the car’s paint, if it slips out, you could cause damage.  Also, note that your current lights have likely been in the same place for a very long time.  It may take some time and a few hits of the screwdriver to loosen them so they slide over.

2. Once they do slide to the right, pull them down and out of the trunk lid.  Unplug the electrical connection by squeezing the tab and pulling.  The new LED lights that you purchased have both the old-style and new-style connections.  Depending on what year and model your car is, you’ll need one or the other.  Plug your new light in using the same cable for the car in the correct port on the light.  

3. Push the light into the trunk lid firmly, and let it settle itself back to the left.

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

You’re done!  Turn on your lights, and enjoy a much whiter, brighter, and more modern looking rear end to your BMW.
