After two weeks of a detailed check-up at BMW Dubai (AED 4,000 or $1,100 USD) plus my additional instructions, I came to understand that the core of this car is healthy. The only big mechanical aspects are: front wishbones, rear wheel bearings suspensions (Alpina specific, will cost a fortune as I want genuine OEM only), the rubber disc connecting the gearbox output to the prop-shaft, and the spinning crankshaft joint. Also the AC/dynamo belts and steering are weak.

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

Four pages of the five page report from BMW are purely cosmetic items.

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

In addition to that, I’ll repaint this car, the clear coat is fading away, and she has many scratches and small dents. After hesitating about the color, I decided to go for the Alpina Blue (that we can see on the new B4), that I will purchase from BMW as there is no choice, it’s an exclusive distribution channel). I will add the full silver dekoset.

The champagne leather is messed up, so I will change it totally, including the console and seats. The center console is broken, it will get repaired by the leather guy as well. I will also try to pass the back panel, where the speakers are, in the same light champagne leather. The birch-yellow wood is okay. Expected bill: AED 20,000, $5,500.

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

I will get rid of the navigation system and put a next generation Pioneer NEX product.  This will bring iOS in the car, Car Play, touch screen, Siri voice commands on steering wheel, bluetooth, etc). But, as I want to keep the original look, I will try to see if I can keep the edges of the original screen (with the CD buttons, menu buttons, etc).

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

The VERY bad surprise is that, after a phone call with Alpina, we found out that my rims are:  not the original size, they are supposed to be 19″, mine are 18″.  This means that they are replicas. I will order a complete set of 5 rims, and put Pirellis on them. Yes, as a French, I should go for Michelin, but Pirelli are very comfortable, like driving in mayonnaise with your steering-wheel englueded in honey and cotton.  Expected bill: AED 20,000,  $5,500.

I will also do a gearbox oil change, filter change, pan gasket change, and differential fluid change.

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

Additionally, I will also change the Alpina steering wheel as it is peeling, finish the Xenon upgrade (washer, xenon leveler) and change the front grill to the chromatic one, which has vertical bars are supposed to be chromed.

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

Yes, the bill will be huge, especially since I’m a maniac. I’ve the Classic Car spirit, I even wanted to buy a classic but the BMW came at the bad moment… and I choose the BMW. So, I will take the time. I don’t want to rush, spend all my money, and get frustrated because it’s not going fast enough.

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

Update:  I just received the Alpina full documentation, including original full invoice, bench tests, technical datas, etc.

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

The gearbox is a ZF 5H24EH.  The xenons are written to come without intensive wash and without headlamp washer.

Received the BMW quotation: AED 44,000, $12,000. But many of these things are useless or cosmetic.
