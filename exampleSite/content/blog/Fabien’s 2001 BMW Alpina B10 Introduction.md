The BMW E39 Alpina B10 V8 is based on the 540i. Restoration is on-going on this car.  It is claimed to produce 347BHP and 450 Nm (332 lb/ft) of toque for the 4.6 M62B46 V8. The Alpina documentation specific to this car states power output to be 355BHP and 480 Nm (354 lb/ft).  This example is from 2001, with extended Alpina leather, and the 19″ classic Alpina wheels.
