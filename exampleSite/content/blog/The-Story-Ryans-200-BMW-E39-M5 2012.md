**2012**

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

Fa t n  eat b lts.  My cluster’s pixels were committing suicide by the day. It turns out, somebody saw one of my videos showing the problem on YouTube.  He sent me a message, telling me how to get BMW of North America to help fix the problem for less than the cost of a whole new cluster.  This guy had a 2003 525iA do the same thing, and he is now partly responsible for this website, and one of my closest friends.  Thank you, Bobby.  I now have a [face-lift working cluster](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wWt6OlXfu4).

April brought some suspension work: four new struts, new springs, sway-bar links, and Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 2s all around.  May brought a new [windshield](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUVWtE_yQYU).  Following a truck on Ohio Route 8 gave me a nice big chip in my windshield to add to the thousands of other tiny chips.  New OEM glass and seal installed.  June welcomed [face-lift tail lights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QyWfv3Nah4). I had just graduated high school, and chose to use the cash I got my grad party for tail lights.  I know, I’m nerdy.  From Turner Motorsport, I was able to find a Hella retro-fit kit to give my car the Celis LED modern look from the rear.  Wiring some ballasts made my car look just like a 2003, with OEM quality parts.  July brought the shine.  I did the full [Zaino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1r-pfej38o) wax system on the paint, clay bar, the whole nine yards.  November welcomed [real headlights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDmdj9u2rJo).  I got the OEM European-style Hella headlights installed and wired, with pure white LED angel eyes.  These looked infinitely better than the Depos.  December brought on more body work.  I noticed over the summer in some detailing work that I had a very small bubble in the paint in the crest of my driver’s side fender.  I hoped I could get away with ignoring it, but this would not be the case.  I took the car in to a local body shop, and let him clean out the cancerous area, and repaint it. In addition to this, I had a small bubble in the passenger-side corner of my trunk lid repaired.

New facelift cluster.  I was able to get BMW North America to pay for 75% of the labor (Thanks Bobby!)  No more dead pixels.

**November, 2012**

Hella OEM facelift headlights.  The cheapo depos were just that: cheap.  Adding Hella halos really finishes off the front of the M5. LED halo bulbs are the final touch, a clean 6,000 kelvin white light to compliment the xenon low beams.
