Really Ryan, a post about floor mats?  Yeah. This article will identify the proper floor mat part numbers for our E39 M5s. Caramel and English Green are longer available, but black is; and BMW has recently updated it.

Caramel and English Green mats are no longer available new. I recommend that owners of cars with these interiors try the black mats; they prove to be much more practical than the lighter colors.

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

As of ~2019, BMW has again changed these E39 M5 floor mats. They now use the same black textured material on the backings (replacing the gray backing that always pealed off) as the F10 M5 mats do. The material is thinner, more durable, and prevents the mats from sliding on the vehicle’s carpeting.

As of mid 2021, BMW has yet again changed these mats. The ‘///M5’ embroidery is now significantly wider, stronger, and neater; which I view to be an improvement.

**Trunk**

For M5 owners, there was a trunk mat available– was. BMW made the M5 trunk mat for just a few years, while these cars were available new. Thankfully, Shady Hasan of the E39 M5 Owner’s Group on FaceBook has produced an aftermarket alternative that is just as high quality. I have an eye for detail, and these ‘replica’ mats are mighty fine. The backing is the only giveaway, but it is an improvement over the original. Join the FaceBook group for search for Shady for details about availability, ordering, etc. The mat is available in 4 options: Split fold US door, split fold cubby door, non split fold US door, and non split fold cubby door.
