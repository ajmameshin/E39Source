We encourage anyone with an interest to participate in E39Source, whether that be in written or filmed form.  If you own a BMW, and would like to contribute, we’re all ears!  You can sign up to post content here on the site through WordPress.  To post on E39Source’s [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/e39source), simply upload your video to your own channel, and send me a link.  With your permission, I will download that video, do any minor editing of dead space/transitions (not content, opinion,) and then upload to E39Source with credit to your channel.  Simply send me an email <ryan@techinform.us> or message on YouTube to notify me of your upload.

What should your first video include?    Make an introduction. Introduce yourself and your vehicle.  Provide some specs/options/details about your car (how long you’ve had it, milage, color, interior, engine, work you’ve already done, etc.)  Go with it, we have no required format here. Other videos you make could include, but are not limited to, DIYs, tutorials, updates on your vehicle’s status, maintenance you do, anything you’d like.  Just browse through the channel’s current uploads to see what we’ve done in the past, let them inspire you like they inspire me!

Enjoy.  We’re here for the long haul, and we’re thrilled to meet fellow BMW enthusiasts who share our passion for these amazing vehicles. Send us an email, leave us a comment, make us a video.  See you on the road!
