Hello E39Source! I am a new member to this website, and I wanted to get more involved with this close knit group of E39 enthusiasts. I just recently purchased my first M5! I bought it in Seattle, Washington with 148,000 miles on the clock. The interior is immaculate, along with the rest of the car. It honestly doesn’t feel as if it has covered 148,000 miles. I’ve driven upwards of ten M5s and this one takes the cake. It has plenty of get-up and go and, so far has none of the common E39 issues!

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

It has no gas cap rust, no VANOS rattle, no rod bearing noise, no timing chain rattle, no busted cup holders, and no pixel issues. I will, however, be experiencing some of these I am sure because all of my other E39s have at some point. I believe I got this for a good deal, considering the other M5s I went to look at were in a much worse condition. The salesmen were quite friendly, and there was no pressure to buy this car. It has heated seats, a power rear sunshade, a 6-disc CD changer, Dinan Stage 1 engine software, Dinan mufflers, a new clutch, new tires, and a very meticulous previous owner. I have receipts spanning all the way back to 2002. I’m so glad I finally own one of these beasts, my dream is now a reality!
