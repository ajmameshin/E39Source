Hello everyone, I hope winter is going well so far! I’ve been a long-time member on M5Board, and I thought I’d swing over to this neighborhood to check out the scene! It’s a great technical and video based site in my opinion. My name is Jackson, and I live all the way up in Minnesota, also known as a**hole in the winter.

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

To begin, I’ve always loved the E39 chassis. It was actually my first love as a child, and will always be my favorite platform on any automobile. I wouldn’t trade it for anything else. Once I was around more friends’ E39 M5s in college, I knew I wanted one, and set out to get a decent job, and start saving. Not more than a year and a half later, I found the right M5. True E39 enthusiasts WILL wait for the right car, and numerous nights have been spent awake going over all sorts of things that would come up. Color, accident history, condition, owner feedback, distance, etc. They were all obstacles on the checklist that I needed to cross off, and more times than not, my checklist was incomplete.

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

Long story short, a friend on the M5board sold me my baby, and I have taken great care of her over the last year and a half of my actual ownership. I picked it up in Chicago over the July 4th, 2012 weekend, and drove it back with my dad. It needed a few things to freshen it up, such as a tune, as the old one was unhealthy rich running, new tires, new cup holders, and some other small cosmetic items.

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

Right now, as for upcoming maintenance, I’m facing some brake shudder, and I’ve been chasing this for a while, the “twisted seat” issue, and the obligitory mirror bubble. As for modifications to the car, it has Schrick sports camshafts, Active Autowerks intake, Supersprint headers, Supersprint X pipe, Supersprint race cats, Eisenmann Race mufflers, Brembo 4 piston BBK, UUC stage 2 clutch, lightweight flywheel, UUC DSSR, KW Variant 2 coilovers, Dinan 3.45 differential, Evolve custom (dyno) tuned software, and Varsstoen LM wheels. Cosmetics include roof painted jet black, slimmbones rear diffuser, hella euro clear headlights, black kidney grills, and carbon fiber interior trim wrap.  I will include my photos down below, thanks for reading!
