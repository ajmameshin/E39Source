**2013**

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

Navigation.  In the 2001 model year, BMW upgraded the E39’s [navigation](http://e39source.com/archives/797) display to a 16:9 widescreen instrument.  The computer also got upgraded.  I took this a step further, and bought a MKIV computer in addition to 16:9 display.  Big upgrade for this car, DVD readability and all!

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

I spent much of 2013 fixing the larger issues.  They weren’t even large, but they bothered me.  I replaced intake camshaft sensors, installed new floor matts and white fog bulbs, changed [transmission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgBcC6nKDH0) and [differential](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ekmxh8du3I4)oils, replaced control arms and tie rods, added LED license plate lights, had some more minor rust marks removed, changed shifter bushings, added a UUC Evo 3 short shift kit, replaced the [FSU and blower motor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3CP9RXiX0M) and replaced my [mass air flow sensors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUTX5BkNz7c).

Ohio got some fog.  I took advantage of this, and snapped these.

Another fun thing we have in January is snow.  Silverstone Metallic paint and white halo-bulbs looks good with snow, as I found out.

Detroit Auto Show.  We decided to make the trek to Detroit again this year, but this time we took the M5.  Thanks Alex for your T3i’s photos!

**February, 2013**

Navigation.  MKIV and 16:9 install, mostly plug-and-play, except for the trimble that must be bypassed!  This is a solid upgrade to the car’s technology and looks, and even a good bit to the functionality.  Be sure to watch the [installation how-to](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYUndmzuyvw) video for the systems, and the [software-update](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7sFrpnXFCs) video on [E39Source](http://www.youtube.com/E39Source)!

**March 24, 2013**

Road Trip, Camshaft Position Sensors.  Winter has been awful, time to take a trip!  Colton Frey from E39Source lived outside of Baltimore, MD.  At the time, he had a 2001 540i/6 and was very active here in the community.  Colton and I visited New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington D.C, and Wilmington, DE.  Be sure to watch the [road trip video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBjfv1LjNQ&list=UUK2CGqOui50uyVa6-H_o8nA&index=1) I posted to our [channel](http://www.youtube.com/E39Source)!  The M5 covered 1,345 miles on this 5 day trip, but didn’t make it out totally free.  The Peake Research tool pulled 08, B8, and 71. VANOS position sensors Bank 1 & 2, and intake camshaft position sensor bank 2.  I ordered the parts, had them installed, and the codes didn’t return.  More maintenance to add to my belt!  In addition to failing camshaft position sensors, my hood switch died.  You can read the [article](http://e39source.com/archives/971), and watch the video [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DzrVl_pm_g).  Colton and I installed white fog bulbs in the M5 as well, which completed my front light white-out.  A great road trip, in a great car, with a great friend.  Of course, Colton and I had to get some pictures with our cars together.

After such a road trip, it came time for a wash upon my return home.  Finally Ohio’s miserable weather broke 35, actually all of the way up to a balmy 42.  After a good wash, and some fresh Zaino Z6, I snapped a few more photos.  I also pulled the rubber floor matts for some fresh carpeted M5 matts I had purchased a few months back.  You can read an [article](http://e39source.com/archives/964) detailing the proper products, or watch the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT2mQ784U-k).

Zaino.  Spring is here, it’s time for the Zaino application!  The whole process took me 3 days, and just over 24 hours.  The process sounds like this.  Z7 wash, clay bar, Z7 wash, Z6 spray, Z5 application, Z6 spray, Z2 application, Z6 spray, Z8 spray.  This left with me the most perfect paint I’ve ever seen on this car.  It looks and feels like glass!

**June, 2013**  Wheel Detail, Timmayfest 2013 Preparation  

With Timmayfest 2013 just two days away, I decided to detail my wheels to same extent that I did my paint.  Clay bar, Zaino, and 20 hours.  Wheels look brand new and are baby smooth, still with their original finish too!

**June 8th, 2013**

Timmayfest 2013.  The first few photos show our convoy, then the show in Columbus, and then the remainder of the weekend back at home.  This will be my first time at Timmayfest, in Columbus Ohio.  Consider Timmayfest as the Bimmerfest or MPact of the midwest.  It’s not quite as large, but we did see visitors from California, New York, Baltimore, Chicago, Florida, Texas, etc.  I convoyed down in my freshly detailed M5 with Kennan and his 2001 525i/5, Colton and his 2001 540i/6, Chase with his 2003 M5, and Andrew with his 2000 M5.

**July, 2013** LED License Plate Lights, a few summer photos 

My halogen license plate lights were in horrible shape.  So, I decided to replace them with the newer style [LED lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtHoQ-kUae8).  When parked next to an F10 or F30, mine and the new look identical.  I also threw in a few photos from this summer!

Video.  Per popular request from our YouTube channel, I have filmed a full, in-depth tour ‘intro’ style video to my car.  It’s fully exposed in this very long video:

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

{{< youtube YvOAyVeGeV4 >}}

Time for a few small parts, and some maintenance.  Firstly, updated [BMW wheel center caps](http://e39source.com/archives/1386).  BMW changed them in 2003, so I updated mine to this much nicer design.  I installed the BMW oil pouch in the trunk, bought some touch-up paint, and then I began to focus on mechanics.  Inner tie rod, outer tie rods, idler arm, pitman arm, lower control arms, and an oil change.  The car now doesn’t creak if it’s hot outside!  I will include some more summer photos with this update:
