**Time Required:** Less than 10 minutes

I had to replace this item because my sunshade stopped retracting, due to the little plastic tabs breaking that hold the roller in place. It would still hook on, but because there was nothing holding it at that length, it would come unclipped and flop all around. I purchased my replacement part from a user on [BimmerForums](http://forums.bimmerforums.com/forum/index.php), and I saved about $100 over buying it online, or through the dealer.

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

**Procedure:** Open the door, and look at the top part of the sunshade, near where the plastic cover meets the top of the door. You probably will not see the little metal tab, but stick the small screwdriver underneath, and you should be able to feel it. Simply stick the screwdriver under the tab, and pry up, gently. You will feel the sunshade come unsnapped. Take the top side out first. Installation of the new part is very simple, just insert the bottom side of the sunshade first, then snap the top back in.

&nbsp;<br/><br/>

Congratulations, by this point, you should have a brand new sunshade installed! It really is a simple install. Go take the money that you saved by not going to the dealer, and spend it on some preventative maintenance, like a transmission fluid service.
