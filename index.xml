I could write a book about this, but I’ll try not to here. I’ve been an M5 owner for over 12 years and 85,000 miles now. Over the past 4 years, me and my term have serviced hundreds of E39 M5s. The E39 M5’s S62 V8 can last 300,000 miles on original components. The S62 can also fail at 40,000 miles. Thankfully, there seem to be many more instances of higher miles than lower.</description></item><item><title>Migrate from Jekyll</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/migrate-from-jekyll/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/migrate-from-jekyll/</guid><description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description></item><item><title>Products</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/products/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/products/</guid><description>Products Products go here
