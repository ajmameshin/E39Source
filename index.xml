Somehow, I didn’t kill myself. By 2011, the void of E39 M5 DIY content online made me think ‘If I want to see this content, maybe others would too.’ I decided to spearhead the lack of online content with E39Source. This has allowed me to connect with thousands of fellow E39 (M5) owners. Now after 12+ years of E39 M5 experience, I have come to know this platform quite well. For the first 8 years, I serviced my own vehicle. Since 2018, I have been offering my speciality E39 M5 services professionally at our shop located in San Diego, California&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>BMW E39: Automatic Headlight Retrofit</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/automatic-headlight-retrofit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/automatic-headlight-retrofit/</guid><description>For the 2002 model year (from 9/1/2001 production), BMWs came standard with automatic headlights.

There are countless variations between BMWs produced and sold in the European market vs those sold here, in the US / North American (DE93) market. This article will highlight some of those differences.
Hyperlinks in this article will point to more E39Source content about installing or retrofitting some of these components.
Europe Got:
Rear Fog Lights: The lower, inner portions of the tail lights were used as rear fog lights to increase vehicle visibility in foggy conditions.</description></item><item><title>BMW E39: Facelift Lighting</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/facelift-lighting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/facelift-lighting/</guid><description>BMW made constant changes to the E39 throughout production. I detail the majority of these changes this article. Some of the most noticeable differences are in the lighting elements. The 2001 facelift brought new headlights, fog lights, and tail lights to the E39. This article will detail the upgrade process from 1996-2000 lights to 2001+ lights.
There is a right way and a wrong way to go about this. If you use Ebay to search for E39 headlights and tail lights, you will find several significantly cheaper alternatives to what I recommend using.</description></item><item><title>BMW E39: Facelift Steering Wheel Upgrade</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/facelift-steering-wheel-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/facelift-steering-wheel-upgrade/</guid><description>For 2001, BMW gave the E39 M5 the E46 M3 steering wheel. Before this, it had used the E36 M3’s wheel. The newer wheel looks a lot more modern and feels much more sporty due to it’s thicker girth, and more pronounced side bolsters. The E46 wheel also allows you to finally see both the top of the gauges and the cluster LCD display at the same time! Depending on when your E39 was made, this update process can be super easy, or damn near impossible.</description></item><item><title>BMW E39: HVAC Panel Facelift</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/hvac-panel-facelift/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/hvac-panel-facelift/</guid><description>This is a minor item to facelift, but it was included in the E39 2001 model year refresh nonetheless.

I could write a book about this, but I’ll try not to here. I’ve been an M5 owner for over 12 years and 85,000 miles now. Over the past 4 years, me and my term have serviced hundreds of E39 M5s. The E39 M5’s S62 V8 can last 300,000 miles on original components. The S62 can also fail at 40,000 miles. Thankfully, there seem to be many more instances of higher miles than lower.</description></item><item><title>E39 Production Changes</title><link>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/production-changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajmameshin.github.io/E39Source/blog/production-changes/</guid><description>The BMW E39 5-series was produced from 09/1995-06/2003 for the 1996-2003 model years.
