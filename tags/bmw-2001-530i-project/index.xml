&lt;p>This is my 2001 BMW 530i 5 speed. I bought this car in June of this year from a guy in Minnesota. I found the car on Craigslist, and bought it for $6,500, which was a great deal. I originally wanted an M5, but they were out of my price range, so I started looking for a 540i. After some research, I found out that the V8s are a pain to repair, and the MPGs are awful, so I decided to go for a 530i. I was specifically looking for a 530i with a manual box, which was difficult to find in South Dakota. After searching for about 3 weeks, I found this one. It met all of my criteria: facelift model with the angel eyes, 5 speed box, M bumpers, BBS style wheels, it just had my name written all over it! After about a week, it was finally in my driveway: my first BMW! Below are the pictures of it from the Craigslist ad.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
