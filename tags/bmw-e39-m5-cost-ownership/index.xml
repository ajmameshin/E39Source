&lt;p>Anybody can afford to buy a used BMW. But maintaining a used BMW is another story. After all, the most expensive car you every buy will probably be a cheap BMW. This is a case study of an E39 M5 owner after 9 years and 100,000 miles. So, what did that cost?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. The operating cost of the car is 53 Cents per mile.&lt;/strong> The average cost for a large sedan is 56 cents per mile (AAA 2018).
