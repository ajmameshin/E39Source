&lt;p&gt;Lesson Learned – Do Not Overfill the Cooling System. I described my experience changing the thermostat housing on my 1997 528i, but I did not describe the problem (a result of my mistake) that followed.

Excess pressure and (important for this discussion) excess coolant vented from the system through a tube to either the ground or an atmospheric reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
