There is a problem with the positive battery cable; the tin on the connector may degrade over time, causing electrical problems, stalling, or even a complete loss of power while the vehicle is in motion. The affected vehicles include: 1 Series coupes and convertibles (both 128i and 135i) from the 2008 to 2011 model years; 3 Series sedans, coupes, convertibles and sport wagons (both 328i and 335i) from the 2007 to 2012 model years; and Z4 roadsters from the 2009 model year to present date.</description></item></channel></rss>
