I found out about the car a few months ago via a friend and I loosely knew the previous owner before as I were childhood friends with his brother.
PO bought the car in oct 2014 and drove it the 100 miles south from Stockholm to his home, and a week later a 500 mile round trip to get the pixels fixed, that it, he hasn’t driven it any more since.</description></item></channel></rss>
