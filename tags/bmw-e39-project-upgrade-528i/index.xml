&lt;p>Hey guys, thanks for welcoming me to E39source! I’ve been a YouTube subscriber for quite a while now, and actually met some of you at the Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix last summer. My name is Mike, and I’m 25 years old and live/work in West Chester, PA. I currently have two E39s: a 1997 528i, and a 2000 M5.&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;br/>&lt;br/>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My 528i is a 3/96 build, with almost 305k miles on it now. This was my first car, and I’ve owned it for over 8 years and 60k miles now! I’ve done so much maintenance to this car, most notably the top end rebuild that was done at 275k miles due to a leaking head gasket. At the time the head gasket was replaced, all seals in top end were replaced, along with the addition of S52 cams and Raceland headers. I also fitted a new radiator and water pump. This is an automatic-transmission car, and as far as I know, the transmission fluid is still original. The engine is the original M52 as well. As far as mods go, I’ve done quite a bit to this car to make it my own. Performance wise I already mentioned the S52 cams and headers but this winter I’m going to have a Supersprint resonator delete, and a Vibrant muffler installed.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
