Easy, peasy, lemon squeeze: all you need to do is retrofit your stock plastic lens E36 headlights with bi-xenon projectors. With some modification from a Dremel, razor blade, and a pry tool, you too can have HID lighting without resorting to a eat-ramen-every-night college-esque budget.

The M52B25 and M52B28 engines can be found in the E36, E39, E38, and in some early E46 models. This is not the easiest modification, but if you are at least a little bit handy, it is not difficult. Some people say that this will gain an additional 20HP, while some say it won’t give you any. I believe that there are power benefits.</description></item></channel></rss>
