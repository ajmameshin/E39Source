&lt;p>BMW is testing a new version of the F10 M5, which is expected to be launched this summer as a 2014 model. It will continue to be offered with its 560-hp, twin-turbo, 4.4-liter V-8, but there will also be an optional performance pack- called the Competition Package, which will consist of several upgrades to the current M5.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Â &lt;br/>&lt;br/>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The output of the higher-performance M5 and M6 models will rise from 560 to 575 horsepower. In addition, both models should receive distinct wheels, black exhaust tips, a revised suspension which will be tuned in favor of a sportier ride with crisper handling, and a more direct steering ratio.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
