The information in this article is only applicable to BMWs that speak the same electronics ‘language’. Many BMW models and series speak this same language, utilize the same connectors, and make use of the same hardware-software interface.

I could write a book about this, but I’ll try not to here. I’ve been an M5 owner for over 12 years and 85,000 miles now. Over the past 4 years, me and my term have serviced hundreds of E39 M5s. The E39 M5’s S62 V8 can last 300,000 miles on original components. The S62 can also fail at 40,000 miles. Thankfully, there seem to be many more instances of higher miles than lower.</description></item></channel></rss>
