&lt;p>It’s a guy thing. In the garage or shop of any car enthusiast, you’re likely to find dozens of car products. Soaps, tire shines, glass cleaners, leather conditioners, assorted towels, brushes, sponges, etc. We like to spend our weekends polishing our cars, even if they only go back in the garage directly afterwards. For some reason, it’s a therapeutic process. Like any process, there are dozens of ways to go about it. With automotive detailing, there are millions of ways to do it wrong. Waxing and polishing products are tools, and like any tool, they are only productively effective when used correctly. Zaino products are my tools of choice. This article is designed to detail the correct way to complete the Zaino wax process on your vehicle, and then maintain all of your hard work.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
