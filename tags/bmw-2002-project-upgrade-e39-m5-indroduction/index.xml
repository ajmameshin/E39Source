&lt;p>Hello everyone, I hope winter is going well so far! I’ve been a long-time member on M5Board, and I thought I’d swing over to this neighborhood to check out the scene! It’s a great technical and video based site in my opinion. My name is Jackson, and I live all the way up in Minnesota, also known as a**hole in the winter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;br/>&lt;br/>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To begin, I’ve always loved the E39 chassis. It was actually my first love as a child, and will always be my favorite platform on any automobile. I wouldn’t trade it for anything else. Once I was around more friends’ E39 M5s in college, I knew I wanted one, and set out to get a decent job, and start saving. Not more than a year and a half later, I found the right M5. True E39 enthusiasts WILL wait for the right car, and numerous nights have been spent awake going over all sorts of things that would come up. Color, accident history, condition, owner feedback, distance, etc. They were all obstacles on the checklist that I needed to cross off, and more times than not, my checklist was incomplete.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
